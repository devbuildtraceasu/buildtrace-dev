Segmentation to separate out legend vs drawing (sam 3) or gemini

Extract drawing specific notes and stuff because it will cover bubbles there from the segmented area.

Convert the extracted drawing into 4 quadrants -> very strong prompt that captures all information with provisions such that it can be used to combine later
 
send for detailed captioning and capture all information with legend passed alongside -. information synthesis and knowledge base building step 

how can we convert this to spatially related nodes -> embeddingstorage should give good performance



then combine all information of that drawing with grid level specifications -> high quality synthesis prompt and top llm call after synthesis


ATTEMPT -1 
1. upload 1 drawing , segment it only legend and drawing and two segments(right side)(75 % + 25 % )
2. From the drawing ->  convert 4 quadrants and caption with this support .(of separated legend)
3. synthesise these (4) quadrant captions and full drawing image to combine information for detailed drawing info. 
    till here we should have at least grid level info of every component.
4. full drawing caption new synthesised with detailed quadrant level info too.
5. Perform search and retrieval on this 

First step is making sure the captions contain enough information 
Human level evaluations needed at this level .

        
ATTEMPT -2
1. Above steps after making sure the synthesised information covers all go level stuff.
2. Now update the 4 quadrants information with relation to the total information. (Decide if images go in this prompt too).
