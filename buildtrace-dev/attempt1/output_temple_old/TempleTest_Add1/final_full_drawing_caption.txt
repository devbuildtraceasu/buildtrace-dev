### **SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS & FLOW**
1.  **Public Access:** Patrons enter at the Southwest corner (Grid G/4.5). The sequence flows from **Vestibule 100** -> **Entry 101**.
2.  **Patron Separation:** From Entry 101, patrons separate into **Non-Patron Waiting 102** (North) or **Patron Waiting 114** (East).
3.  **Processing:** Patrons moving to the Baptistry proceed from Waiting 114 -> **Vestibule 179** -> **Clothing Issue 178** (to collect clothing) -> North to Dressing Rooms.
4.  **Baptistry Loop:** The Sisters' Baptistry suite functions as a loop: **Vestibule 170** (Entry) -> **Dressing 173** (Change) -> **Showers 171/172** (Cleanse) -> **Baptistry 169** (Ordinance).
5.  **Service Block:** The "wet" service wall (Laundry, Restrooms, Showers) is consolidated along Grid F/G to centralize plumbing.

### **SUMMARY**
This drawing (A20-05) details "Area A" of Level 01, specifically the Sisters' Baptistry and Main Entry. It features a precise grid system (I-D.5 vertical, 8-4.5 horizontal). The plan includes 19 distinct spaces, 20+ doors, and specific accessibility/safety features like touchless actuators and Knoxboxes. The layout emphasizes a clear separation between public entry, patron processing (clothing issue), and the sacred ordinance space (Baptistry font).

### **REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS**

**Synthesis Process:**
1.  **Grid Reconstruction:** I utilized the full drawing image to verify the grid labels (I, H, G, F, E, D.5 top; 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5 right). This corrected the error in the Q4 caption which misidentified grids as "C" and "B".
2.  **Data Integration:**
    *   **Room Names & Numbers:** Extracted from Quadrant Captions (Q2, Q3, Q4) and verified against the full image for spelling and number accuracy (e.g., confirming "161B" vs "161").
    *   **Keynotes:** Correlated the hexagonal numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) on the plan with the "Sheet Note Schedule" visible in the bottom right of the full image.
    *   **Dimensions:** Read directly from the dimension strings at the top and left of the full image to ensure precision.
3.  **Verification:**
    *   *Conflict Resolution:* The Q3 caption placed the Entry at "Grid E to D", but the full image clearly shows it at Grid G-F. I used the visual evidence of the full image to assign the correct Grid G-F location to the Entry zone.
    *   *Completeness:* I visually scanned the full image for items missed in quadrant captions, such as the specific location of FECs and the "Open to Below" note in the Baptistry.

**Sources:**
*   **Full Drawing Image:** Primary source for grid labels, global dimensions, and spatial verification.
*   **Quadrant Captions (Q1-Q4):** Source for OCR text of room names and initial object identification.
*   **Quadrant Synthesis:** Used as a checklist to ensure all previously identified zones were included.

**Confidence:** High. The grid system is clearly legible, and the text labels for rooms and notes are sharp, allowing for a definitive transcription.
