## GRID SYSTEM
- **Grid format:** Lettered grids run **vertically** (left-to-right across sheet: **I, H, G, F, E, D.5, D** visible); numbered grids run **horizontally** (top-to-bottom on right edge: **8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5** visible).  
- **Orientation:** Plan is oriented with **grid bubbles along top for letters** and **along right for numbers**. North arrow is present in the legend/title block zone (right side of sheet).  
- **Key grid spacings (top dimension string):**
  - **I–H = 11'-8"** (Q1)
  - **H–G = 27'-0"** (Q1)
  - **F–E zone dimensions shown:** **23'-2"**, **23'-2 1/2"**, **17'-0 1/2"** across the top near grids **F, E, D.5** (Q2; verified in full image)
- **Horizontal datums:** Two long **dashed horizontal grid/datums** traverse the sheet (Q1), aligning with right-side numbered grids (8/7 region).

> **Grid-level convention used below:** When exact extents are not fully bounded by visible grid intersections in the crop, locations are expressed as **grid bands** (e.g., “between E–D and 7–6”) and/or **at/near a gridline** (e.g., “at E/7”). This matches what is actually readable in the full sheet and quadrants.

## SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS (adjacencies, connections, flow paths)

### Primary circulation flow (southwest → northeast)
1. **Exterior → Entry Vestibule (100)** via two south doors.  
2. From **100**, movement splits:
   - **North** into **Non‑Patron Waiting (102)** (two doors along 102’s south edge).  
   - **East** into **Entry (101)**, which acts as a connector toward the building’s central circulation.
3. From the Entry/Waiting zone, circulation continues east/northeast into the **Clothing Issue / Baptistry Corridor** system and further north to the **Baptistry support suite**.

### Clothing / baptistry corridor network
- **Clothing Issue (178)** connects through **Vestibule–Clothing (179)** into **Corridor–Baptistry (180)**.  
- **Corridor–Baptistry (180)** provides access to **FEC**, **Storage 161B**, and **Confirmation 162**, and likely continues north toward the baptistry complex.

### Baptistry suite (Sisters) and baptistry adjacency
- The sisters’ suite is organized with **Dressing (173)** as the hub, linked to **Restroom (174)** and to **Vestibule (170)**, which in turn relates to **Showers (171/172)**.  
- The suite lies immediately **west of Baptistry (169)**, separated by a wall that is heavily callout/revision-clouded.
- **Baptistry (169)** is adjacent to an **OPEN TO BELOW** guarded void, suggesting a significant vertical/ceremonial feature.

### Peripheral/partial
- **Veil Storage (176)** appears on the far east/northeast edge (near Grid G), with a door swinging into the room, indicating an access point along that exterior/edge zone.

- Clothing/corridor/support: 7 (178,179,180,FEC,161B,162,144)  
- Storage edge: 1 (176)

**Doors (explicitly identifiable in provided views):** 12  
- 2 exterior doors into 100  
- 2 doors between 102 and entry zone

**Callouts/markers (distinct sheet refs observed, not counting repeats):** ~20+  
(High density of A60-series and A7x-series; exact total depends on counting repeated A60-14 and multiple diamonds.)

---

## REASONING AND SOURCES
### How synthesis was performed
- Built a single grid framework using **letter bubbles across the top** (I through D.5) and **number bubbles on the right** (8 through 4.5), then placed each room/door/callout into the **smallest confidently readable grid band** using the quadrant captions and cross-checking against the full sheet image.
- Deduplicated repeating callouts by **sheet reference + view number** when readable; where view numbers were not readable (common for A60 diamonds), retained as “A60-xx (multiple)”.

### Information from Q1 (top-left)
- Established **I/H/G** grid presence and key spacings **11'-8"** and **27'-0"**.
- Captured **A42-03** callouts and **A71-01** callouts at lower datum.
- Identified partial **VEIL STORAGE 176** and its door swing; located near **Grid G** edge.

### Information from Q2 (top-right)
- Captured baptistry suite room program: **169–175** and “OPEN TO BELOW”.
- Added top dimension set near **F/E/D.5**.
- Captured dense callout set: **A60-14**, **A60-20**, **A75-20**, **A76-05/06**, **A71-01**, **AG05-32**, plus revision cloud **B**.

### Information from Q3 (bottom-left)
- Captured entry/public cluster rooms **100–105, 152** and their door relationships.
- Captured callouts: **A71-02**, **A72-02**, **A05-31**, **A05-32**, **A60-15**, **A60-30/31/34/44**, **A75-30**, plus **SF01**.
- Confirmed plan title/scale and view reference **1/A20-05**.

### Information from Q4 (bottom-right)
- Captured clothing/corridor/support rooms **178, 179, 180, FEC, 161B, 162, 144**.
- Captured explicitly labeled **door IDs**: **178, 179B, 163A, 161B**.
- Captured key interior elevation references **A60-2.1**, **A60-0.74 (approx.)**, and **9/A75-05 SIM**.

### Full image verification (what was checked against the full sheet)
- Verified **overall placement**: entry cluster is southwest; sisters’ baptistry suite is northeast; clothing/corridor/support is southeast-central.
- Verified that the **grid bubbles and top/right dimension strings** align across quadrants (letters on top, numbers on right).
- Verified adjacency logic (e.g., **179 between 178 and 180**, **161B and 162 east of corridor**, **173 hub**).

### Conflicts resolved
- **“FEC” appears twice**: resolved by treating as two separate labels—one as a general annotation near entry/waiting circulation (Q3), and one as an actual labeled room/closet off Corridor 180 (Q4). The full image supports two distinct placements.
- **Window identification**: Q1 suggests storefront-like vertical bays; since no tags are visible anywhere, recorded as **probable glazing** but **not counted as a window component**.

### Confidence assessment
- **High confidence:** room names/numbers listed in quadrants; door IDs in Q4; major adjacencies; grid label set and key top dimensions.  
- **Medium confidence:** exact grid-span extents for each room (because not all grid intersections are fully visible in the crops); confirmation door lacking printed ID.  
- **Low confidence:** untagged window/storefront interpretation at Grid G edge; exact meaning of “FEC” annotation in Q3 (device vs. note) beyond the text itself.

If you want, I can output this same knowledge base as **structured JSON** (rooms/doors/callouts keyed by grid band + sheet ref) for downstream indexing/search.
