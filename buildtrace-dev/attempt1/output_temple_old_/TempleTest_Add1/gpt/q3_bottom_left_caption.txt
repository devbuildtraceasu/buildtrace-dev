## 2) Doors, openings, and swing directions (as visible)

### Doors between **Non-Patron Waiting 102** and adjacent spaces
- **Two single swing doors along the bottom boundary of Room 102** (opening from the waiting room down into the entry/vestibule zone):
  1. **Left door:** near the junction above First Aid Closet 152 / Entry Vestibule 100 area; door arc shown swinging (arc indicates a hinged leaf; exact swing direction reads as swinging downward into the lower area from the waiting room wall line).
  2. **Right door:** closer to the Entry 101 side; another single swing door with arc shown similarly.
- **Door tags:** no explicit door-number tag boxes are clearly legible in this region; only door leafs/arcs are drawn.

### Doors associated with **Entry Vestibule 100**
- **Two door swings at the lower edge of Entry Vestibule 100** (suggesting exterior entry doors or vestibule doors):
  - One swing shown at the left side of vestibule bottom opening.
  - Another swing shown at the right side of vestibule bottom opening.
- The arcs indicate **in-swing** into the vestibule (curved arcs drawn inside vestibule footprint).

### Door at **First Aid Closet 152**
- A **single hinged door** into the First Aid Closet is implied by the wall opening at the closet boundary (door arc is subtle; the closet is immediately adjacent to the vestibule/entry zone).

### Restroom/Vestibule doors (partial)
- **Restroom 105** door visible with swing arc near Vestibule 104 (upper-right); exact hinge side is shown by the arc at the opening.

## 3) Walls, millwork/fixtures, and notable architectural elements

- **Exterior wall thickness** and stepped wall profiles visible along the left/top portions of the plan area; multiple wall lineweights denote structural/exterior vs interior partitions.
- **Left-side exterior/entry feature:** a small **rectangular projecting bay** with wall offsets and a **small black filled rectangle** (possible equipment/stop/marker) appears on the left wall segment adjacent to the large waiting room.
- **Small curved/round architectural feature** at far left-middle: a **circular/rounded element** inside a small outlined enclosure (possibly a niche/column/feature) with concentric arcs and a small square at center (looks like a circular pedestal/feature or site/entry element) located left of Entry Vestibule and below the higher-level left projection.
- **Square pad with circular concentric ring symbol** (left-lower mid): a larger square outline containing a circular concentric symbol and a central square—reads like a **site/structural pad/feature** (possibly a footing/fountain/monument base). It is enclosed by dashed/rounded-corner boundary lines around it.
- **Hatched element (millwork hatch per legend)**: at lower-right edge of the region, a **diagonal hatch-filled rectangular mass** appears (consistent with legend “MILLWORK” hatch). It sits adjacent to the Entry 101 area and near several callout bubbles (A75-30 references).
- **Dashed rectangles** inside Non-Patron Waiting 102 near the bottom wall line (two dashed boxed zones) indicating clearances, furniture zones, or equipment footprints (no explicit label inside these dashed boxes in this region).

## 4) Annotations, dimensions, and text (all visible)

### Dimension
- **Vertical dimension** at upper-left edge: **“18'-5"”** (dimension string runs vertically, indicating a major offset/setback distance at the left side of the plan).

### General labels
- **“FEC”** text printed near the corridor/transition area right of Non-Patron Waiting 102 and near Shoe & Coat 103 zone (likely Fire Extinguisher Cabinet).

### Plan title / scale (bottom border area)
- **“FLOOR PLAN - LEVEL 01 AREA A”**  
- **“SCALE: 1/4" = 1'-0"”**

### File/job text (vertical along left border)
- A long vertical line of text appears along the left sheet margin; partially legible as an Autodesk/Revit or project/job identification string (exact characters not fully readable in this region).

## 5) Callouts, section/elevation markers, and detail references (with sheet refs)

> Per legend context: circular/diamond markers are **section/elevation/detail callouts** with **view number(s)** and **sheet number**; red text indicates the target sheet (e.g., A60-xx, A05-xx, A71-02, etc.).

### Left/central callouts near the exterior/entry approach
- **Circular section/detail bubbles** along the left side and lower-left:
  - **“4 / A71-02”** (circle) near upper-left of this region.
  - **“2 / A71-02”** (circle) near lower-left/left-middle.
  - **“3 / A71-02”** (circle) near left of Entry Vestibule/door zone.
- **Small circular marker “5 / A72-02”** near the left wall of the main building mass (upper-left of waiting room boundary).
- **Hexagonal tag “SF01”** with a leader pointing to an element on the left wall (likely a storefront/frame type tag or special feature tag).
- **Diamond-shaped marker with bold black triangular base** near lower-left center: labeled with red sheet reference **“A60-15”**; above it a smaller circular/numbered marker references **“A05-31”** (two markers clustered).
- Additional small triangular/circular marker at far lower-left labeled **“1 / A42-01”** (partially visible).

### Callouts within/around Entry Vestibule 100 and Entry 101
- Near Entry Vestibule 100: a **circular multi-number marker** with red reference **“A60-15”** (numbers appear like 7/2/5 within the circle—multi-part callout).
- In the Entry 101 zone: multiple markers:
  - **“9 / A05-32”** (callout with triangular/marker base) near the right-hand door from Waiting 102 down toward Entry.
  - **“6 / A05-32”** (similar style) slightly below/left of the “9/A05-32”.
  - A diamond/circle marker with red sheet **“A60-30”** near Entry 101 label (multi-number cluster inside diamond).
  - Another small circular marker with red sheet **“A30-08”** (text is small but reads A30-08) near the A60-30 callout.

### Right-lower edge callouts near millwork-hatched block
- Two circular detail bubbles near bottom-right:
  - **“3 / A75-30”**
  - **“2 / A75-30”**
  These are positioned adjacent to the **diagonal hatched (millwork) block**, indicating related details on A75-30.

### Upper-right vestibule/restroom callouts
- A multi-number diamond marker near Restroom/Vestibule area with red reference **“A60-44”** (adjacent to Restroom 105 area).
- Another marker in Vestibule 104 area with red reference **“A60-31”**.

## 6) Spatial relationships / circulation (adjacency and flow)

- **Non-Patron Waiting 102** is the dominant space in this region, bounded on the **right** by a cluster of service/support spaces (**Vestibule 104**, **Restroom 105**, **Shoe & Coat 103**) and on the **bottom** by access points to the **Entry 101** and **Entry Vestibule 100**.
- **First Aid Closet 152** sits directly **below the waiting room’s lower-left edge**, functioning as a small support room adjacent to the **Entry Vestibule 100**.
- **Entry Vestibule 100** connects the interior to the exterior via **two bottom doors**, and connects upward/adjacent into the building circulation toward Waiting 102 and Entry 101.
- **Entry 101** is immediately **to the right of Entry Vestibule 100**, serving as the main entry circulation zone; it is heavily annotated with multiple detail/elevation references (A05-32, A60-30, A30-08) and is adjacent to a **millwork-hatched** element (likely built-in casework/desk/bench).

---

## 7) Items NOT visible / not legible in this region (for retrieval clarity)
- No explicit **window tags**, **door numbers**, or **wall type tags** are clearly legible within this cropped quadrant (only door swings and openings are visible).
- No matchlines are visible in this quadrant.
- No explicit fire-rating bar graphics (1HR/2HR FRR) are visible here, though wall thickness suggests exterior vs interior partitions.
