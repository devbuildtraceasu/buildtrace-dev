## GRID SYSTEM:
- **Grid format/orientation:**  
  - **Lettered grids run vertically** (grid bubbles along **top**). Visible: **I, H, G, F, E, D.5, D**.  
  - **Numbered grids run horizontally** (grid bubbles along **right edge**). Visible: **8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5**.  
- **Reference datums:** Two long **dashed horizontal datums/gridlines** traverse the plan, aligning with the right-side numbered grids (notably across the **8/7 band** area).  
- **Key grid spacings (top dimension string):**  
  - **I–H = 11'-8"** (along top, spanning Grids **I to H**).  
  - **H–G = 27'-0"** (along top, spanning Grids **H to G**).  
  - Additional top dimensions near Grids **F/E/D.5**: **23'-2"**, **23'-2 1/2"**, **17'-0 1/2"** (top string across the **F–E–D.5** zone).  
- **Other major dimensions:** Far-left vertical dimension string includes **47'-4"** and **234'-1 1/2"** tied to the dashed horizontal datums; a local vertical dimension **18'-5"** appears near the SW entry approach/entry suite.

## SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS (adjacencies, connectivity, flow; with grid context)
- **Primary arrival sequence (SW):** **Exterior → Entry Vestibule 100 (E–D/6–5)** via paired exterior doors; from 100, circulation splits **north to Non‑Patron Waiting 102 (E–D/7–6)** (two doors) and **east to Entry 101 (near D/6–5)** leading toward the central/corridor network.  
- **Entry support cluster:** **First Aid Closet 152 (E–D/near 6)** supports the entry zone; **Shoe & Coat 103 (near D/7–6)** supports waiting/entry; **Vestibule 104 (near D/8–7)** connects to **Restroom 105 (near D/8–7)**.  
- **Service-to-baptistry relationship:** **Laundry 175 (F–E/8–7)** sits west of the sisters’ suite circulation, supporting baptistry operations.  
- **Sisters’ suite organization (NE):** **Dressing 173 (F–E/8–7)** acts as hub to **Restroom 174 (F–E/near 7)**, **Vestibule 170 (F–E/near 8)**, and **Showers 171/172 (west of F/8–7)**; suite is immediately **west of Baptistry 169 (E–D.5/8–7)**.  
- **Baptistry adjacency/vertical feature:** **Baptistry 169** directly abuts **OPEN TO BELOW** at **east of D.5 / 8–7**, indicating a guarded atrium/void condition.  
- **SE-central clothing/corridor spine:** **Clothing Issue 178 (E–D/6–5)** → **Vestibule–Clothing 179 (near D/6–5)** → **Corridor–Baptistry 180 (near D/6–4.5)**; corridor serves **FEC (east of D/6–5)**, **Storage 161B (east of D/6–5)**, and **Confirmation 162 (D.5–D/6–5)**, and continues north toward baptistry-related areas.  
- **Peripheral storage:** **Veil Storage 176** at **near G / ~7 band** indicates additional support storage at the east/northeast edge.

## REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS (verification + confidence)
- **Sources used:**  
  1) **quadrant_synthesis (grid-level knowledge base)** for the consolidated grid framework, room/door inventories, callout lists, and dimension values.  
  2) **quadrant_captions (Q1–Q4)** for localized room labels, door tags, view references (1/A20-05), plan title/scale, and callout placements.  
  3) **full_drawing_image** to verify overall spatial arrangement (SW entry cluster; NE baptistry/sisters’ suite; SE clothing/corridor/support), confirm grid bubble orientation (letters top, numbers right), and confirm the presence/location of right-side notes/legend/north arrow/title block.
- **Integration process (step-by-step):**  
  1) Established a single coordinate system from the sheet: **letters on top (I→D)** and **numbers on right (8→4.5)**.  
  2) Placed each room/door/callout into the **smallest reliably readable grid band** (e.g., “between E–D and 7–6”) as provided by the synthesis and quadrant captions.  
  3) Deduplicated repeated callouts by **sheet reference + view number** when readable; retained “multiple” where diamonds repeat without unique IDs.  
  4) Cross-checked adjacency logic against the full image (e.g., **178–179–180 sequence; 173 as sisters’ hub; 169 adjacent to OPEN TO BELOW**).
- **Verification notes:**  
  - **Verified in full_drawing_image:** major room groupings, the right-side legend/notes and north arrow, and the overall corridor linkages.  
  - **Verified in quadrant data:** specific room numbers/names, door IDs in Q4, and callout sheet references.  
- **Confidence:**  
  - **High:** room names/numbers listed; major adjacencies; door IDs in Q4; grid orientation and key top dimensions (I–H 11'-8", H–G 27'-0", and F/E/D.5 top dimensions).  
  - **Medium:** exact extents/boundaries of rooms across precise grid intersections (some are only readable as grid bands); unlabeled confirmation door ID.  
  - **Low:** untagged window/storefront interpretation near Grid G (recorded as “probable glazing” only); the exact functional meaning of the **FEC** annotation near the entry zone versus the explicit **FEC room** off Corridor 180 (handled as two distinct occurrences per synthesis).
