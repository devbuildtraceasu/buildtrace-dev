### **SUMMARY**
This drawing, **Sheet A20-05 (Level 01 Area A)**, details the western portion of a temple floor plan. It features a distinct separation between the public entry/waiting zones in the South (Grids 4.5-6) and the sacred Baptistry complex in the North (Grids 7-8). The plan includes 19 labeled spaces, extensive millwork in support areas (Clothing Issue/Shoe & Coat), and specific revision clouds indicating recent changes to the shower and baptistry wall configurations.

### **REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS**

*   **Synthesis Process:** I integrated the vertical grid labels (I, H, G, F, E, D.5, C, B) and horizontal labels (8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5) from the quadrant analysis to create a unified coordinate system.
*   **Room Verification:**
    *   *Source:* Quadrant 2 provided the detailed "Sisters" wing layout (Rooms 170-175).
    *   *Source:* Quadrant 4 provided the "Clothing Issue" and "Patron Waiting" layout.
    *   *Verification:* I cross-referenced the "Open to Below" note in the full image to confirm the Baptistry's location at Grid D.5.
*   **Annotation Resolution:**
    *   *Conflict:* Keynote [2] appeared in two spots.
    *   *Resolution:* The legend states "Final Location TBD," explaining why it appears both on the exterior (likely physical box) and interior (likely security tie-in). Both locations were listed for completeness.
*   **Grid Precision:** Every room and door was assigned a coordinate based on the intersection of the grid lines visible in the full image.
*   **Confidence:** High. The text labels for rooms, keynotes, and grids are legible, and the standard architectural symbols (door swings, glazing) are clear.
