### **SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS & FLOW**

1.  **Patron Arrival:** Patrons enter from the South (Grid 4.5) into Vestibule [100].
2.  **Check-in/Waiting:** Flow moves North to Non-Patron Waiting [102] or East to Entry [101] and Patron Waiting [114].
3.  **Service Sequence:** From Waiting [102/114], patrons move to Shoe & Coat [103] or Clothing Issue [178].
4.  **Ordinance Preparation:** From Clothing Issue, flow moves North through Vestibule [179] to the Baptistry Dressing area [173] (Sisters).
5.  **Ordinance:** From Dressing [173], patrons enter the Baptistry Vestibule [170] and proceed to the Baptistry [169] (Grid D.5).
6.  **Support:** Laundry [175] and Storage [176] are tucked on the West perimeter (Grid G), separated from public flow.

### **REASONING AND SOURCES**

**Synthesis Process:**
1.  **Grid Establishment:** I combined the vertical grid labels from Q1 (I, H, G), Q2 (F, E, D.5), and Q4 (C, B) to create the West-to-East sequence. I combined horizontal labels from Q2 (8, 7) and Q4 (6, 5, 4.5) for the North-to-South sequence.
2.  **Room Mapping:**
    *   *Q1 & Q3:* Provided the West perimeter rooms (Veil Storage, Entry Complex). Verified against the full image to align Veil Storage (176) vertically above the Entry (100).
    *   *Q2:* Provided the detailed "Sisters" wing layout. The "Open to Below" label confirmed the Baptistry location.
    *   *Q4:* Provided the South-East support spaces. The adjacency of Vestibule 179 to Clothing Issue 178 was derived from the door swings shown in the full image.
3.  **Annotation Resolution:**
    *   *Conflict:* Keynote [2] (Knoxbox) appeared in two locations. Q3 caption placed it exterior; Q2 caption placed it interior. *Resolution:* I listed both locations in the synthesis, noting one is likely the exterior access box and the other an interior tie-in or device, as per the legend "To be tied into security system."
    *   *Conflict:* Grid continuity. The gap between Grid D.5 and C suggests a corridor or wall thickness not fully labeled, but the Matchline confirms the building extends East.
4.  **Verification:**
    *   Verified the "Phenolic Shower Door" (Note 4) against the legend and the specific arrows in Q2 pointing to the shower stalls.
    *   Verified the "Linear Floor Drain" (Note 3) locations by looking for the bubble [3] in the full image within the dashed floor patterns in Q2.

**Confidence Assessment:**
*   **Grid Coordinates:** High confidence.
*   **Room Names/Numbers:** High confidence (clearly legible).
*   **Door Swings:** High confidence (standard symbols used).
*   **Wall Types:** Medium confidence (visual distinction between thick exterior/chase walls and thin partitions is clear, but specific assembly types rely on tags like "P1x" which are small).
