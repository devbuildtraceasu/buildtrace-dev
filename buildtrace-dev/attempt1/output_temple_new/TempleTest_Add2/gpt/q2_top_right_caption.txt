Top-right quadrant of floor plan sheet **TempleTest_Add2 – Page 1**, showing the **Baptistry suite** area with adjacent showers, dressing/vestibule, restroom, laundry edge, and the main **BAPTISTRY** space including an **OPEN TO BELOW** octagonal volume. Region includes architectural walls/partitions, door swings, accessibility clearances (dashed), multiple detail/section callouts (A60-xx / A61-xx / A71-01 / A75-20 / A76-05 / A76-06 / A05-32), grid bubbles (E, F, D.5) and horizontal grids (7, 8). Red revision clouding encloses several modified areas; red delta triangles with letters mark revisions.

## 1) Grid / reference system (precise locations)
- **Vertical grid bubbles at top**:
  - **Grid F**: bubble “F” near top-left of region; a vertical dashed gridline drops down through the left half of the image.
  - **Grid E**: bubble “E” near top-center; vertical gridline implied/short dash segment visible below bubble.
  - **Grid D.5**: bubble “D.5” at top-right; leader indicates its grid position.
- **Horizontal grid bubbles at right**:
  - **Grid 8**: bubble “8” at mid-right, aligned with a horizontal dashed gridline running across the baptistry volume.
  - **Grid 7**: bubble “7” lower-right, aligned with a horizontal dashed gridline crossing the octagonal “open to below” feature.
- **Top dimension strings between grids** (as printed above the plan linework):
  - Near Grid F area: **“23'-7"”** (left top).
  - Between F and E: **“23'-2 1/2"”** (top center).

## 3) Walls, partitions, and millwork (hatches / thickness)
- Building perimeter walls at top and left are thick, multi-line assemblies.
- Multiple interior partitions create the shower rooms (171/172), vestibule (170), dressing (173), and restroom (174).
- **Millwork hatch (diagonal hatch)** is visible in several blocks:
  - In vestibule/dressing boundary zone: two vertically oriented hatched rectangles (upper center-left) that read as millwork/lockers/cabinets.
  - A long **hatched vertical element** along the **east edge of the dressing corridor** adjacent to the Baptistry (169) (center-right), possibly a millwork/storage/bench run.
  - Additional hatched zones appear at lower-right inside a red revision cloud (long horizontal hatched assembly, see §8).

---

## 4) Doors / openings (door swings and locations)
(Doors are shown with swing arcs; exact door numbers are not legible in this crop, but door locations and swing directions are visible.)

- **Door between vestibule/circulation and dressing zone (around Room 173 north side)**:
  - Location: near center, just below vestibule 170; single-leaf swing shown with arc into the adjacent space.
- **Door into Room 174 (restroom)**:
  - Location: lower center-left at the restroom entry; swing arc visible (appears to swing into the restroom).
- **Door(s) along the central spine/corridor near the east side of dressing area (adjacent to Baptistry 169)**:
  - Several openings shown with swing arcs in the narrow passage between dressing and baptistry.
- **Small door/opening near label “173A / 173B”** (see below):
  - Lower center-right, at the transition from the dressing/restroom suite toward the Baptistry side; door swing arc shown.
- **Exterior/perimeter openings/windows**: none clearly identifiable by standard window symbols in this cropped quadrant; the top-right shows a long narrow horizontal wall/beam-like element with a framed assembly and callout (could be clerestory/structural opening), but window tagging is not legible.

---

## 5) Fixtures / plumbing elements (as drawn)
- **Restroom 174**:
  - Toilet symbol visible in the lower-left of restroom.
  - A lavatory/sink symbol visible along wall with a small counter outline.
  - Dashed clearance/approach graphics appear within restroom (typical ADA maneuvering/fixture clearance depiction).
- **Along the east edge of the dressing-to-baptistry passage** (center-right, vertical run):
  - Two circular/oval lavatory-like fixtures or basins drawn in a vertical line within a narrow room/alcove; each shows bowl outline and trap/fixture geometry.
- **Showers 171/172**:
  - Shower-related fixture outlines present but too small to definitively enumerate; spaces are clearly labeled as showers.

---

## 6) Stairs / vertical circulation
- A **stair run** is visible near the center-right, between the dressing suite and the Baptistry side:
  - Location: just right of the center spine wall, near the red revision cloud.
  - Depicted with repeated tread lines, indicating stairs ascending/descending (direction arrow not clearly visible in this crop).

---

## 7) Callouts, section/detail tags, and annotation bubbles (with sheet references)
Multiple circular/diamond callouts appear; legibility varies, but the following are clearly readable in this region:

### A) A71-01 references (top center/right)
- **“4 / A71-01”** callout near the upper center over vestibule/roofline transition.
- **“2 / A71-01”** callout near top-right over a long horizontal assembly (possibly a canopy/beam/wall section).

### B) A60-20 references (right of center, near Baptistry)
- **“4 / A60-20”** near upper-right portion of the Baptistry zone (to the right of Grid 8).
- **“5 / A60-20”** near mid-right of the Baptistry area (left of the octagon).

### C) A76 series (Baptistry area)
- **“1 / A76-05”** near center-right, adjacent to the Baptistry label.
- **“2 / A76-05”** appears near lower-right edge, close to the octagon and revision cloud area.
- **“11 / A76-06”** tag near the upper-middle of the Baptistry zone.

### D) A05-32 (special diamond tag)
- A dark/filled diamond-style tag reading **“2 / A05-32”** located near upper-center-right, at the edge between vestibule/corridor and Baptistry open area.

### E) A60-11 and A60-12 / A61-01 (left/center suite)
- Several stacked multi-number callouts appear in the showers/dressing/restroom area:
  - **A60-11** tags near shower 171 and near the dressing area.
  - **A60-12** tag appears near the Laundry (175) edge.
  - **A61-01** tags appear near the central spine and at the restroom entry area; at least one tag shows a cluster of view numbers (e.g., “28/27/26 … / A61-01” type stack) though the individual view numbers are small.
- Circular detail bubbles labeled with numbers such as **3**, **4**, **5** appear in the dressing area (likely keyed notes or detail references).

---

## 8) Red revision markup / clouds and delta triangles
- **Red revision clouds** outline modified areas:
  - A large cloud wraps the **lower-right horizontal hatched assembly** (likely millwork or a wall/bench element) near the bottom-right edge of the region.
  - A vertical cloud runs along the **east side of the dressing-to-baptistry passage**, adjacent to the hatched vertical element and the two fixture symbols.
  - Red clouding also appears along the bottom edge of the left-side suite (near Laundry and adjacent corridor), indicating changes at that boundary.
- **Red revision delta triangles with letters**:
  - A red delta **“F”** appears near the center-left (around dressing area / wall intersection).
  - Red delta **“K”** appears near the center-right (along the vertical cloud by the passage) and again near the bottom-right clouded area.
  - Red delta **“B”** appears near the center-right lower portion, close to the vertical cloud.

---

## 9) Other annotations / misc. text
- **“FEC”** appears near the lower-left edge adjacent to the Laundry/adjacent wall (likely fire extinguisher cabinet location note).
- Small green markers/dots appear along some walls/edges (possibly coordination markers or fastener/anchor indicators; not identified in the legend provided).

---

## 10) Spatial relationships / circulation summary (adjacencies)
- The **Sisters’ Baptistry support suite** is arranged west-to-east: **Showers (171, 172)** on the far left → **Vestibule (170)** at top center → **Dressing (173)** centrally → **Restroom (174)** at lower center-left, with a narrow passage/corridor and stair adjacent on the east side leading toward the main **BAPTISTRY (169)** on the right.
- The **BAPTISTRY (169)** open area sits directly **east** of the sisters’ suite and contains/abuts the prominent **octagonal “OPEN TO BELOW”** feature.
- The plan is controlled by grids **F–E–D.5** (vertical) and **8/7** (horizontal), with the Baptistry volume primarily between **Grids 7 and 8**, and the sisters’ suite largely between **Grids E and F**.
