Visible descriptions (some are partially obscured by a red cloud/markup in the provided image). Transcribed exactly as legible:

1. **“TOUCHLESS ACTUATOR CONTROL FOR DOOR AUTO OPERATOR.”**
2. **“BASIS OF DESIGN: LCN 8310-8103. REFER TO INTERIOR ELEVATIONS.”**
3. **“KNOXBOX - FINAL LOCATION TBD. TO BE TIED INTO SECURITY SYSTEM.”**
4. **“LINEAR FLOOR DRAIN. SEE PLUMBING DRAWINGS FOR MORE INFO.”**

## Other notation/conventions explicitly shown in this legend strip
- **“SIM” / “SIMILAR (IF APPLICABLE)”**: Tag modifier indicating the referenced detail/view applies to a similar condition.
- **Typical view numbering convention:** Tags consistently carry **VIEW NUMBER** over/with **SHEET NUMBER** (standard detail reference structure).
- **Clearance graphics are dashed** (clear floor space / maneuvering clearance zones are represented with dashed outlines).
- **Door clearance diagram includes swing arc** (door swing shown with arc; clearance indicated with dashed boundary and dimensions).

If you want, I can also extract the **General Notes – Floor Plan** block on the same strip (it’s not a symbol key, but it contains conventions that affect interpretation).
