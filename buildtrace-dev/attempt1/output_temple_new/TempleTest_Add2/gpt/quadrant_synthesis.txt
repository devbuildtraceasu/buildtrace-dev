## GRID SYSTEM
**Overall structure (from full sheet + quadrant evidence):**
- **Vertical gridlines (letters)** run **north–south** and are labeled along the **top border** with circular bubbles. Observed (left→right across sheet):
  - **I, H, G** (clearly in Q1, continuing into the plan field)
  - **F, E, D.5** (clearly in Q2 at top of plan)
  - (Other lettered grids may exist further right/left, but are not visible/legible in the provided view.)
- **Horizontal gridlines (numbers)** run **east–west** and are labeled along the **right edge** with circular bubbles:
  - **8** and **7** (visible in Q2, aligned to dashed horizontal gridlines crossing the Baptistry).
  - Additional horizontal gridlines likely exist above/below but are not legible in the provided view.

**Key inter-grid dimensions captured:**
- **Between I–H:** 11'-8" (Q1)
- **Between H–G:** 27'-0" (Q1)
- **Top string near Baptistry suite:**
  - segment near F: 23'-7"
  - **F–E:** 23'-2 1/2"
  - **E–D.5:** 17'-0 1/2" (Q2)
- **Vertical bay dimensions at left margin:**
  - 17'-11"
  - 23'-11 1/2" (Q1)
- **Left-side vertical dimension near entry zone:** 18'-5" (Q3)

**Interpretation note (grid-level precision):**
- Because only **some** horizontal grids (7/8) and **some** vertical letter grids (I through D.5) are visible, grid “coordinates” below are expressed as **spans between known gridlines** and **approximate placement relative to grid intersections** (e.g., “between E–F and near Grid 7”). Where the sheet does not show a grid crossing, I flag it as **grid not visible in crop**.

## SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS

2. **Baptistry support suite to Baptistry (north/east portion):**  
   **Showers 171/172** + **Vestibule 170** → **Dressing 173** → **Restroom 174** and passage/stair zone → **BAPTISTRY 169** (Q2).

3. **Clothing/service flow (central/south-east portion):**  
   **CLOTHING ISSUE 178** → **VESTIBULE CLOTHING 179** → **CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY 180** → **STORAGE 161B** → **CONFIRMATION 162** (Q4).  
   Corridor also continues south to additional open/circulation area (Q4).

4. **Laundry adjacency:**  
   **LAUNDRY 175** sits near the sisters’ suite and adjacent circulation linking toward Clothing/Baptistry corridor systems (Q2 + full image).

5. **Vertical volume relationship:**

(door numbers not legible; counted by distinct described door locations across quadrants)

**Windows: 0 identifiable** (not legible/tagged in provided image)

**Annotations/callouts (distinct references listed): ~39**
- Includes grid dimensions, title/scale, FEC tags, and the readable callout references enumerated above. (Many additional callouts exist but are too small to read precisely.)

---

## REASONING AND SOURCES
**How synthesis was performed (critical method):**
- I treated each quadrant caption as a **high-confidence localized extraction**, then used the **full sheet image** to:
  1) place each quadrant’s content into the overall plan,  
  2) deduplicate repeated items (e.g., FEC appears in multiple areas), and  
  3) convert “regional” locations into **grid-referenced spans** wherever grid bubbles/lines are visible (notably for the Baptistry zone between **E–D.5** and **7–8**, and the top-left field between **I–H–G**).

### Information from Q1 (top-left)
- Confirmed **vertical grids I, H, G** and their **dimension strings** (11'-8", 27'-0").
- Captured **vertical dimensions** (17'-11", 23'-11 1/2").
- Captured **callouts**: 1/A42-03, 2/A42-03, 3/A71-01, 1/A71-01.
- Partial room/door evidence: **VEIL STORAGE 176** fragment and partial door swing.

### Information from Q2 (top-right)
- Primary grid-anchored program: **BAPTISTRY 169 between grids 7–8 and E–D.5**.
- Sisters’ suite rooms **170–175** and their relationships.
- Callouts: A71-01, A60-20, A76-05, A76-06, A05-32, plus A60-11/A60-12/A61-01 clusters.
- Fixtures/clearances and major revision clouds/deltas (F, K, B).
- FEC near Laundry edge.

### Information from Q3 (bottom-left)
- Entry cluster rooms: **100, 101, 102, 152**, plus partial **103/104/105**.
- Plan title, view reference **1/A20-05**, and scale.
- Callouts: A71-02, A72-02, A60-15, A60-30, A30-10, A75-30, A05-32.
- Revision cloud with delta **K** around First Aid/vestibule area.

### Information from Q4 (bottom-right)
- Clothing/corridor/support cluster rooms: **178, 179, 180, 161B, 162**, plus partial **177** and **114**.
- Multiple A60-series callouts, plus **9/A75-05 SIM**, and **FEC** in Corridor 180.
- Revision clouds and delta markers **K** and **J**.

### Full image verification (what was checked against the full drawing)
- Verified that Q2’s grid system (**F/E/D.5** and **7/8**) is indeed the Baptistry zone and that the “OPEN TO BELOW” octagon sits within that bay.
- Verified that Q3’s title/scale correspond to the sheet’s main plan view.
- Verified that the right-side legend strip exists (supporting symbol interpretations), but room/door/window tags remain too small to reliably read door numbers.

### Conflicts resolved
- **Room “176”**: Q1 suggests “VEIL STORAGE 176” and shows “176” near a door swing. Q4 contains 177/178/179/180 cluster and does not contradict 176. I treated 176 as a **distinct storage room** adjacent to the clothing/baptistry circulation zone.
- **Grid positioning for Q3/Q4 rooms**: Q3 and Q4 crops lack clear grid bubbles; therefore I did **not** fabricate grid coordinates. I provided **approximate** alignment only where the full image and nearby known grids make it reasonable, and flagged these as inferred.

### Confidence assessment
- **High confidence:**  
  - Grid IDs and dimensions in Q1 and Q2; Baptistry (169) location between **E–D.5** and **7–8**; room names/numbers listed explicitly in quadrant captions.
- **Medium confidence:**  
  - Relative placement of Laundry/Clothing/Corridor cluster to nearby grids (inferred from full-image alignment without local grid bubbles).
- **Low confidence / not determinable:**  
  - **Door numbers**, **window inventory**, and exact grid intersections for Q3/Q4 doors/rooms due to illegible tags and missing grid bubbles in those crops.

If you want true “Room X spans Grid A–B / 1–2” style coordinates for **all** rooms and doors, I’ll need either: (1) a higher-resolution export where grid bubbles are legible across the entire plan area, or (2) the adjacent sheet with the complete grid extents visible.
