# GRID SYSTEM:
- **Vertical gridlines (letters; run N–S; bubbles at top border):** **I, H, G, F, E, D.5** (left→right as visible).  
- **Horizontal gridlines (numbers; run E–W; bubbles at right edge):** **8** and **7** (visible; dashed horizontal gridlines crossing Baptistry zone).  
- **Key inter-grid dimensions (top dimension string; where readable):**
  - **I–H = 11'-8"** (Grid I to Grid H).
  - **H–G = 27'-0"** (Grid H to Grid G).
  - **(segment near Grid F) = 23'-7"** (adjacent top segment preceding F–E string).
  - **F–E = 23'-2 1/2"**.
  - **E–D.5 = 17'-0 1/2"**.
- **Vertical bay dimensions (left-side strings; where readable):** **17'-11"**, **23'-11 1/2"**, and **18'-5"** (left margin/entry-zone string).  
- **Grid-precision note:** Full-grid coordinates are **exact** where grid bubbles/lines are visible (notably Baptistry zone at **E–D.5 / 7–8** and top-left grids **I–H–G**). Areas without visible bubbles in the crop are located by **span to nearest known grids** and flagged as **inferred** (no fabricated grid IDs).

# SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS (circulation + adjacency; with grid context)
1. **Public entry flow (southwest; Grid H–F inferred):** Exterior/approach → **Entry Vestibule 100 (Grid G–F inferred)** → **Entry 101 (Grid G–F inferred)** → **Non-Patron Waiting 102 (Grid H–F inferred)** + access to support spaces (**First Aid 152**, **Shoe & Coat 103**, **Vestibule 104**, **Restroom 105**; all in same inferred grid band).  
2. **Sisters’ baptistry support to Baptistry (Grid F–E exact to E–D.5 exact):** **Vestibule 170 / Showers 171–172 / Dressing 173 / Restroom 174 (Grid F–E exact)** → passage along **Grid E** → **Baptistry 169 (Grid E–D.5 / 8–7 exact)**.  
3. **Service/clothing to baptistry corridor chain (Grid G–E inferred):** **Clothing Issue 178 (Grid G–F inferred)** → **Vestibule Clothing 179 (Grid F–E inferred)** → **Corridor–Baptistry 180 (near Grid E inferred)** → **Storage 161B (Grid E–D.5 inferred)** → **Confirmation 162 (Grid E–D.5 inferred)**; corridor continues south to larger circulation area.  
4. **Laundry adjacency (Grid G–F inferred):** **Laundry 175** sits adjacent to circulation that ties clothing/corridor system to the sisters’ suite and baptistry approach.  
5. **Vertical volume relationship (Grid E–D.5 / near 7 exact):** **Open to Below** octagon is embedded within **Baptistry 169**, indicating a multi-story space/void.

# REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS (synthesis + verification)
- **Sources used:**  
  1) **quadrant_synthesis (grid-level knowledge base)** for consolidated room list, grid IDs, dimension strings, callouts, revisions, and confidence notes.  
  2) **quadrant_captions (Q1–Q4)** for localized extraction of visible text (room names/numbers, callout IDs, door swing presence, and quadrant-specific symbols).  
  3) **full_drawing_image** for overall placement verification: confirming Baptistry (169) location relative to grids **E–D.5 / 7–8**, confirming sheet title block/right-side legend zone, and confirming that Q3 content aligns with the plan title and scale region.
- **Integration method (step-by-step):**  
  1) Established the **grid framework** only where bubbles/dashed gridlines are visible (I–D.5 at top; 7–8 at right).  
  2) Anchored **Baptistry 169** and **Open to Below** to **E–D.5 / 7–8** using Q2 + full image corroboration.  
  3) Placed the remaining rooms by **explicit adjacency chains** (entry cluster; clothing→corridor→storage→confirmation; suite→baptistry) and assigned **grid spans as “inferred”** when bubbles were not visible in that plan region.  
  4) Compiled **all callouts/notes/revisions** listed across quadrants, attaching grid vicinity as exact where possible (Baptistry zone) and inferred elsewhere (entry/clothing zones).
- **Verification performed against full_drawing_image:**  
  - Confirmed grid bubbles **I, H, G, F, E, D.5** and numeric bubbles **7, 8** appear as described; confirmed Baptistry label and octagonal “open to below” are within the **E–D.5 / 7–8** bay; confirmed right-side legend/notes/title block presence and the plan title at the bottom.
- **Confidence levels:**  
  - **High:** grid IDs/dimensions where read; Baptistry (169) + Open to Below location **E–D.5 / 7–8**; sisters’ suite room labels 170–174; callout sheet numbers listed in quadrant synthesis.  
  - **Medium:** relative placement of Laundry 175 and clothing/corridor/storage/confirmation cluster to grids (assigned as inferred due to missing grid bubbles locally).  
  - **Low / not determinable:** **door numbers**, **window schedule/inventory**, and exact grid intersections for Q3/Q4 rooms/doors (grid bubbles not visible/legible in those regions in provided image).
