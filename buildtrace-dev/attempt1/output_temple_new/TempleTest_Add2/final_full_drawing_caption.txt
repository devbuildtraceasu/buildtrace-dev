### **SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS**
1.  **Public to Private Transition:** The plan moves from public assembly (West: Entry/Waiting) through a controlled Vestibule (104) and Service Core (Center) to the sacred/ritual spaces (East: Baptistry/Confirmation).
2.  **Baptistry Isolation:** The Baptistry complex (North East) functions as a semi-independent suite with its own vestibule (170), hygiene facilities (171-174), and ritual space (169).
3.  **Circulation Spine:** Corridor 180 (Grid E) is the primary artery for the eastern block, distributing traffic between the Baptistry, Confirmation, Clothing Issue, and Patron Waiting.
4.  **Service Buffer:** The block containing Laundry, Equipment, and Restrooms (Grid G-F) acts as an acoustic and physical buffer between the Waiting area and the Ritual area.

### **SUMMARY**
This drawing, **TempleTest_Add2**, depicts **Level 01 - Area A** of a religious facility. It features **21 distinct spaces**, **17 doors**, and **7 window units**. The plan is characterized by a clear division between western public waiting areas and eastern ritual spaces (Baptistry/Confirmation). Significant design revisions (marked by red clouds) are concentrated in the central service core and the southeastern corridor/confirmation access points, suggesting recent optimization of traffic flow and room configurations.

### **REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS**
*   **Synthesis Strategy:** I constructed the master grid by correlating the visible grid bubbles in the full image (I-D.5, 8-4.5) with the partial data in the quadrant captions.
*   **Missing Data Recovery (Q3):** The Q3 caption was missing. I visually extracted the bottom-left quadrant data (Entry Vestibule 100, First Aid 152, Non-Patron Waiting 102) directly from the full resolution image to ensure complete coverage.
*   **Conflict Resolution (Grid Labels):** The Q4 caption incorrectly identified the Clothing Issue area as "Grid C." Visual verification against the full image confirmed this area lies between Grid F and Grid E. I corrected this in the final text to maintain spatial accuracy.
*   **Revision Analysis:** I overlaid the textual descriptions of "Red Clouds" from the quadrant captions onto the visual map to precisely locate the "Hot Zones" of design change, specifically the massive reconfiguration in the Corridor 180 area.
