### **REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS**

**Synthesis Process:**
1.  **Grid Alignment (Source: Full Drawing Image):**
    *   *Reasoning:* The quadrant captions had minor discrepancies regarding the exact location of Grid E. I verified against the full image where the grid bubbles are clearly visible at the top. Grid E aligns with the wall separating the Baptistry Showers from the Baptistry Vestibule.
    *   *Correction:* Adjusted all room coordinates to align strictly with the I, H, G, F, E, D.5 vertical system and 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5 horizontal system.

2.  **Room Inventory (Source: Quadrant Captions + Full Image):**
    *   *Integration:* Combined the detailed room lists from Q1 (Exterior/Storage), Q2 (Baptistry/Laundry), Q3 (Entry/Restroom), and Q4 (Clothing/Corridor).
    *   *Verification:* Checked the "Patron Waiting 114" which was visible in Q4 but partially cut off; confirmed its location via the full image. Confirmed "First Aid 152" location relative to the Revision Cloud.

3.  **Annotation Mapping (Source: Sheet Note Schedule):**
    *   *Process:* The Sheet Note Schedule (bottom right of full image) lists notes 1-5. I mapped these numbers to their specific locations on the plan (e.g., finding every instance of [1] and [2]).
    *   *Confidence:* High. The symbols are distinct squares/circles with numbers.

4.  **Revision Analysis (Source: Visual Inspection):**
    *   *Reasoning:* The red clouds are the most visually prominent feature. I correlated the "Delta K" symbol found in the clouds with the Revision Schedule (top right) to confirm they represent "ADDENDUM 2 - ONGOING COORDINATION" or similar recent changes.

**Confidence Level:** High. The combination of high-resolution quadrant analysis and full-context image verification allows for precise grid positioning and text recognition.
