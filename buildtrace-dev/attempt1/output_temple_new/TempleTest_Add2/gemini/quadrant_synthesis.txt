### **5. SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS & FLOW**
*   **Public Entry Sequence:** Patrons enter at the South-West corner (Grid I-H) into **Entry Vestibule 100**, proceeding to **Entry 101**.
*   **Support Transition:** From Entry 101, flow moves North to **Shoe & Coat 103**, then East through **Vestibule 104** to access **Restroom 105** or **Clothing Issue 178**.
*   **Baptistry Circulation:** The **Baptistry Suite (Sisters)** is located in the North-East (Grid F-D.5 / 8-7). It is accessed via **Baptistry Vestibule 170** (North) or internally via the corridor system connecting to **Vestibule 179**.
*   **Service Core:** A central block (Grid G-F / 7-6) contains **Laundry 175**, **Veil Storage 176**, and **Equipment 177**, separating the public entry from the ritual spaces.
*   **Ritual Access:** **Clothing Issue 178** acts as a gateway to the ritual areas, leading into **Vestibule 179**, which distributes flow to **Corridor 180**, **Storage**, and **Confirmation**.

*   **Total Doors Identified:** 14

### **REASONING AND SOURCES**

**Synthesis Process:**
1.  **Grid Alignment (Critical Step):**
    *   *Conflict Resolution:* The Quadrant 3 caption stated Grid E was at the "bottom margin" aligning with Entry Vestibule 100. However, visual analysis of the **Full Drawing Image** confirms that Grid E is actually the vertical line separating the Baptistry Vestibule 170 from the Baptistry Font 169, and runs down between Corridor 180 and Storage 161B.
    *   *Correction:* I aligned the grid based on the continuous lines visible in the full image:
        *   **Grid I:** Far Left.
        *   **Grid H:** Left of Entry 101.
        *   **Grid G:** Left of Laundry 175.
        *   **Grid F:** Right of Laundry 175.
        *   **Grid E:** Right of Showers / Left of Baptistry Vestibule.
    *   *Source:* Full Drawing Image visual verification overrides Q3 text caption.

2.  **Component Extraction:**
    *   **Q1 (Top Left):** Provided details for Veil Storage 176 and the exterior setbacks. Confirmed the "Unnamed Wet Area" is the Laundry/Restroom block.
    *   **Q2 (Top Right):** Provided detailed breakdown of the Baptistry Sisters' suite (170-174), Laundry 175, and the Font 169. Identified Keynotes [3], [4], [5].
    *   **Q3 (Bottom Left):** Provided details for Entry 100, First Aid 152, Entry 101, and Restroom 105. Identified Keynotes [1], [2] and Revision Delta K.
    *   **Q4 (Bottom Right):** Provided details for Clothing Issue 178, Vestibule 179, Corridor 180, and Confirmation 162. Confirmed the layout of the "Clothing Issue" block relative to the grid.

3.  **Verification:**
    *   Verified the "Red Clouds" across all quadrants against the Sheet Note Schedule to ensure context (e.g., Note [1] appearing in multiple locations).
    *   Verified door swings and types against the Legend provided in the context.

**Confidence Assessment:**
*   **Grid Locations:** High (Visual alignment is consistent across the full sheet).
*   **Room Names/Numbers:** High (Clearly legible in quadrants).
*   **Revision Context:** High (Clouds are distinct and labeled).
*   **Wall Types:** Low (Specific wall types like P1x are mentioned in the legend but not legible on individual wall tags in the image; generic "Structural" vs "Partition" distinction used).
