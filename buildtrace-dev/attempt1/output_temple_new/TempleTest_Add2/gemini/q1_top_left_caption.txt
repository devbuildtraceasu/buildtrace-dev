**Architectural Drawing Analysis: TempleTest_Add2, Page 1 (Top-Left Quadrant)**

**Region Overview**
This region depicts the upper-left exterior corner of the site and a portion of the building's interior layout located in the bottom-right of the quadrant. The area is defined by structural Grid Lines I, H, and G. The majority of the upper and left portions of the image represent exterior space or setbacks, while the built environment begins to the right of Grid G.

**Grid Systems and Dimensions**
*   **Vertical Grid Lines:**
    *   **Grid I:** Located on the far left.
    *   **Grid H:** Located centrally.
    *   **Grid G:** Located on the right side, marking the primary vertical structural line for the visible building portion.
*   **Horizontal Dimensions (Top):**
    *   Distance between Grid I and Grid H: **11'-8"**.
    *   Distance between Grid H and Grid G: **27'-0"**.
*   **Vertical Dimensions (Left Side):**
    *   Upper segment dimension: **17'-11"**.
    *   Lower segment dimension: **23'-1 1/2"**.
*   **Timestamp:** Located in the top-left margin, vertical text reads: "9/12/2025 3:56:06 PM".

**Building Interior (Bottom Right of Quadrant)**
The built area is located to the right of Grid G.

*   **Room: VEIL STORAGE 176**
    *   **Location:** Bottom right corner of the image.
    *   **Room Tag:** "VEIL STORAGE" (Top), "176" (Bottom in oval).
    *   **Door 176:**
        *   **Tag:** Hexagon with text "176".
        *   **Swing:** Single door, swings inward (into the room), hinged on the right.
        *   **Hardware:** A small circle symbol (likely a switch or card reader) is located on the exterior wall adjacent to the latch side of the door.
    *   **Walls:** Enclosed by standard partition walls.

*   **Room: Unnamed Wet Area (Partially Visible)**
    *   **Location:** Immediately North (above) Veil Storage 176.
    *   **Revision Status:** The entire perimeter and interior of this room are surrounded by a **Red Revision Cloud**, indicating a change or focus area (per Sheet Note Schedule context).
    *   **Fixtures:**
        *   **Toilet:** Visible on the West wall.
        *   **Millwork:** Diagonal hatching (indicating Millwork per legend) is visible along the North wall.
    *   **Exterior Wall:** The West-facing wall is depicted with a thicker line weight, indicating an exterior or structural wall.

**Annotations and View Tags**
*   **Exterior Elevation Tags (Triangle pointer):**
    *   **Tag 1/A42-03:** Located to the left of the building wall (near Grid G). The filled black triangle points East (Right) toward the exterior wall of the wet area.
        *   Top: "1" (View Number)
        *   Bottom: "A42-03" (Sheet Number)
    *   **Tag 2/A42-03:** Located to the right of the building wall (partially cut off). The filled black triangle points North (Up).
        *   Top: "2" (View Number)
        *   Bottom: "A42-03" (Sheet Number)

*   **Section Tags (Circle with Triangle Arrow):**
    *   **Tag 3/A71-01:** Located at the bottom center of the image, between Grid H and G. The arrow points North (Up).
        *   Top: "3" (View Number)
        *   Bottom: "A71-01" (Sheet Number)
    *   **Tag 1/A71-01:** Located at the bottom right, below Veil Storage 176. The arrow points North (Up).
        *   Top: "1" (View Number)
        *   Bottom: "A71-01" (Sheet Number)

**Material and Line Work**
*   **Dashed Lines:** Horizontal dashed lines run across the drawing, likely indicating alignment planes or overhead features.
*   **Revision Clouds:** Red scalloped lines (clouds) explicitly highlight the bathroom/wet area above the Veil Storage, signifying recent modifications to the design in that specific zone.
