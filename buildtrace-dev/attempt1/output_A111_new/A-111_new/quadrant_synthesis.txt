━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS & FLOW**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
*   **Primary Workflow:** The facility is divided into two main operational zones: **101-MRF** (North) and **102-BACKYARD** (South), which appear spatially continuous, separated only by the central grid line M.
*   **Material Flow:** Existing conveyors (E2) run through the facility, notably at Grid 14 and Grid 28, suggesting a loop or processing line connecting the MRF and Backyard areas.
*   **Vehicle Access:** Large roll-up doors on the West Wall (D1, D2) and openings on the North Wall allow for heavy truck entry/exit. The "Truck Scales" (E6) in the North Yard confirm this is a receiving/shipping area.
*   **Staff Circulation:** Staff facilities (Restroom 105, Break Room 106) are located at the perimeter (West and East extremes, respectively), keeping pedestrian traffic separate from the central industrial floor.

**REASONING AND SOURCES**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**Synthesis Process:**
1.  **Grid Reconstruction:** I utilized the explicit grid labels from Q1 (0-12, A-M), Q2 (13-37, A-M), and Q3 (0-12, M-GG) to build a mental model of the full coordinate system.
2.  **Q4 Reconstruction (Critical Step):** Since the Q4 caption was missing, I performed a visual extraction of the bottom-right quadrant of the full image. I identified "102-BACKYARD", "106-STAFF BREAK ROOM", and the specific location of the "CAT PAD" and recycling equipment in the south-east region by aligning them with the established grid lines from Q2 (above) and Q3 (left).
3.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   *Break Room Location:* The label "FACE OF CMU BREAK ROOM" at Grid 36 in Q2 suggested the room was far east. However, visual inspection of the plan shows Room 106 is actually at Grid 30-31. I resolved this by interpreting Grid 36 as the limit of the exterior wall or yard wall associated with that zone, while placing the room itself at Grid 30-31 based on the floor plan label.
    *   *Room 101/102 Boundary:* The drawing shows no physical wall between 101 and 102. I defined them as distinct zones based on the room labels but noted their spatial continuity.

**Source Citations:**
*   **Information from Q1:** Front Yard setbacks, Stormwater Chamber (Keynote 3), Bale Storage (Room 103), West Wall Grid 0-2 details.
*   **Information from Q2:** MRF (Room 101) layout, North Wall openings, Pit location, East Wall PEMB details.
*   **Information from Q3:** Staff Restroom (Room 105), West Wall roll-up doors (D1, D2), South-West corner grid layout.
*   **Information from Full Image (filling Q4):** Identification of Room 102 (Backyard), Room 106 (Break Room), Cat Pads, and the continuity of the recycling equipment into the southern half of the building.
*   **Legend Context:** Used to decode symbols (Diamond=New, Square=PEMB) and text abbreviations (V.I.F., R.O.).

**Confidence Assessment:**
*   **Grid Locations:** High Confidence. The grid lines are clearly labeled.
*   **Room Names:** High Confidence. Labels are distinct.
*   **Keynote Numbers:** High Confidence. Symbols are legible.
*   **Specific Door IDs on East Wall:** Medium Confidence. The text for door tags on the far East wall (near Grid 30) is small and slightly pixelated in the full view, but the presence of the opening is clear.
