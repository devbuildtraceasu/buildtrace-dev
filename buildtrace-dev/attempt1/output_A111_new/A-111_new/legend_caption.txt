Based on the provided architectural drawing (A-111, Page 1), here is the comprehensive Legend and Symbol Key extraction.

### **SYMBOL CONVENTIONS**

*   **Diamond Symbol (No Prefix):** Indicates **NEW WORK KEYNOTES**.
*   **Diamond Symbol ('E' Prefix):** Indicates **EXISTING KEYNOTES**.
*   **Square/Rectangle Symbol ('P' Prefix):** Indicates **P.E.M.B. (Pre-Engineered Metal Building) KEYNOTES**.
*   **Circle with Letter/Number (Left Margin):** Grid Line Indicator (e.g., A, B, C, 1, 2).
*   **Circle with Arrow/Triangle (Left Margin):** Section/Detail Cut (e.g., 1/A-301). Top number is the detail number; bottom number is the sheet number.
