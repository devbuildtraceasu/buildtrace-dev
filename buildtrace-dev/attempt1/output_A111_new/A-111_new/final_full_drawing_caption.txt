━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
*   **Operational Flow:** The facility operates as a continuous industrial loop. Material enters via the North Yard (Truck Scales E6), is processed in **101-MRF**, moves via conveyors (E2) south into **102-BACKYARD**, and likely exits via the West or East service yards.
*   **Staff Separation:** Staff zones are strictly perimeter-based. The **Restroom (105)** is an appendage on the far West wall, and the **Break Room (106)** is isolated on the far East wall, keeping pedestrians away from the central heavy machinery and crane zones.
*   **Structural Zoning:** The building is a Pre-Engineered Metal Building (PEMB) structure, evidenced by the regular 25' bay spacing and specific column callouts (P1, P2). The "Bale Storage" (103) appears to be a modified existing structure integrated into the new grid.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**SUMMARY**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This drawing represents the First Floor Plan for a Material Recovery Facility. It details a large industrial floor plate divided into a northern MRF zone and a southern Backyard zone. Key infrastructure includes a large central pit with an overhead crane, extensive conveyor systems, heavy power infrastructure (switchgear/transformers), and stormwater management systems in the front yard. Access is provided by multiple large roll-up doors for trucks and specific man doors for staff, ensuring separation of flows.

**REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**Synthesis Process:**
1.  **Grid Reconstruction:** I utilized the explicit grid labels from the quadrant captions (Q1, Q2, Q3) to build a mental model of the full coordinate system (0-37, A-GG).
2.  **Q4 Reconstruction:** Since the Q4 caption was missing/error-prone, I performed a visual extraction of the bottom-right quadrant of the full image. I identified "102-BACKYARD", "106-STAFF BREAK ROOM", and the specific location of the "CAT PAD" and recycling equipment in the south-east region by aligning them with the established grid lines from Q2 (above) and Q3 (left).
3.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   *Break Room Location:* The label "FACE OF CMU BREAK ROOM" at Grid 36 in Q2 suggested the room was far east. However, visual inspection of the plan shows Room 106 is actually at Grid 30-31. I resolved this by interpreting Grid 36 as the limit of the exterior wall or yard wall associated with that zone, while placing the room itself at Grid 30-31 based on the floor plan label.
    *   *Room 101/102 Boundary:* The drawing shows no physical wall between 101 and 102. I defined them as distinct zones based on the room labels but noted their spatial continuity.

**Sources Used:**
*   **Quadrant Synthesis:** For base grid definitions and room lists.
*   **Quadrant Captions (Q1, Q2, Q3):** For specific dimensions, setbacks, and text labels.
*   **Full Drawing Image:** For verifying spatial relationships, filling the Q4 gap (Backyard/Break Room), and confirming grid intersections for keynotes.

**Confidence:** High. The grid system is explicit, and the combination of text labels and visual verification allows for precise location of all major components.
