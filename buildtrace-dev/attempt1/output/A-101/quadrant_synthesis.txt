### SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS & FLOW

1.  **Site Access:**
    *   Primary vehicle access appears to be from **De Garmo Ave** (North).
    *   Trucks enter the **North Parking Lot** or proceed to the **Scale House (E4)** located East of the MRF Building.

2.  **Building Hierarchy:**
    *   The **MRF Building** (Top) and **Backyard Building** (Bottom) are the two primary masses.
    *   They are structurally aligned along **Grid 18** (West edge of MRF aligns with West edge of South Backyard).
    *   They are separated by a yard space roughly between **Grid D and Grid H**, though connected structurally or via roof overhangs near Grid K.

3.  **Circulation:**
    *   **Pendleton Street (West):** Service access along the "North Backyard" wall (Grid 0). Features a Genset (14) and utility connections.
    *   **Randall Street (East):** Bounded by the "Not A Part" area for the northern half, but borders the **Staff Building/Patio** at the southeast corner (Grid 36-37).
    *   **Internal Flow:** Material likely flows from the MRF (Bale Storage) south into the Backyard Building for processing (Recycling Equipment area).
