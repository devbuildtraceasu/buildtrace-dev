**SUMMARY:**
This site plan (A-101) depicts the proposed renovation and expansion of the Crown Recycling Services facility. The project involves a total proposed building area of **259,136 SF**, comprising the 67,390 SF MRF Building and the 183,945 SF Backyard Processing Building. Key additions include a new Staff Building (+2,160 SF) and Fire Pump Room (+400 SF) at the southeast corner (Grid 36-37). The site is bounded by Pendleton St, De Garmo Ave, and Randall St, with significant hardscape improvements and specific zones for recycling equipment, bale storage, and truck circulation.
