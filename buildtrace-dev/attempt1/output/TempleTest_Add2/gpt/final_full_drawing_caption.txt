**TempleTest_Add2 – Page 1: ENLARGED FLOOR PLAN – LEVEL 01, AREA A (Architectural plan)** showing the **entry / waiting suite**, **clothing issue + patron waiting**, **baptistry corridor spine**, **storage + confirmation rooms**, and the **Baptistry 169 suite (sisters vestibule/dressing/showers/restroom/laundry/veil storage)** with extensive **revision clouds/deltas**, **detail/section callouts**, **FEC (fire extinguisher cabinet) tags**, and **plan graphic legend / general notes** on the right margin.

## GRID SYSTEM:
- **Vertical grid lines (lettered across top, left→right):** **I, H, G, F, E, D.5**.  
- **Horizontal grid lines (numbered bubbles at right margin, top→bottom in this crop):** **8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5**.  
- **Key control dimensions (as shown):**
  - **I–H = 11'-8"** at top control dimension (Grid I to Grid H).  
  - **H–G = 27'-0"** at top control dimension (Grid H to Grid G).  
  - Top control dims near **F/E/D.5**: **≈23'-7"**, **≈23'-2 1/2" (F–E span)**, **≈17'-0 1/2" (E–D.5 span)** (legibility varies; present along top string).  
  - Left-side vertical dimension strings visible: **17'-11"** and **23'-11 1/2"** (upper/left dimension stack), and **18'-5"** (left exterior vertical dimension near entry/waiting).  
  - Local note dimension: **46 1/4"** near restroom/vestibule cluster (approx. **G–F near Grid 7**).

**Grid-location convention used:** locations are expressed as **(letter-bay range) × (number-line band)**, e.g., “**between F–E near Grid 6–7**.” Where the crop prevents exact boundary confirmation, extents are stated approximately but always tied to visible grid bubbles.

## SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS (adjacencies, connections, flow):
- **Primary circulation sequence (public-to-controlled):** **Exterior → ENTRY VESTIBULE 100 (H–G×5) → ENTRY 101 (G–F×5) → support vestibules (103/104/105 at G–F×6–7) → central corridor network → CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY 180 (F–E×6→5/4.5)** feeding baptistry-related functions.  
- **Baptistry sisters support progression:** **Showers 171/172 (G–F×7–8) + Laundry 175 (G–F×6–7) → Dressing 173 (F–E×7) → Restroom 174 (F–E×6–7) → Vestibule 170 (F–E×8) → Baptistry 169 (E–D.5×7–8)**.  
- **Clothing distribution to patron staging:** **CLOTHING ISSUE 178 (G–F×6)** directly connects to **VESTIBULE CLOTHING 179 (F–E×6)** and is immediately north of **PATRON WAITING 114 (G–F×5)**; movement continues to **CORRIDOR 180 (F–E×6→5/4.5)**.  
- **Controlled rooms off corridor:** **STORAGE 161B (E–D.5×6)** and **CONFIRMATION 162 (E–D.5×6–7)** are accessed from **CORRIDOR 180**, indicating secured/support program adjacent to the baptistry route.

## REASONING AND SOURCE CITATIONS (synthesis + verification):
- **Sources used:**  
  1) **quadrant_synthesis (grid-level knowledge base)** for the complete room list, grid system (I/H/G/F/E/D.5 and 8/7/6/5/4.5), control dimensions, door groupings, callout inventories, FEC placements, and revision delta coverage.  
  2) **quadrant_captions (Q1–Q4)** for localized confirmations: entry title/scale (Q3), baptistry suite room labels and top control dims (Q2), clothing/corridor/storage/confirmation labels and revision notes (Q4), and grid spacing dimensions (Q1).  
  3) **full_drawing_image** to verify global continuity: letter-grid order across top, numbered grid bubbles at right, physical adjacency of **Corridor 180** linking clothing/confirmation/storage to the baptistry suite, and the placement of major rooms (Non-Patron Waiting 102, Clothing Issue 178, Baptistry 169).

- **Reasoning / integration process:**  
  - Consolidated each quadrant’s room/annotation set into one deduplicated inventory; then normalized **every item** to a consistent grid-location format using the visible top letter grids and right-side numbered grids.  
  - Resolved the Q4 note about “no full structural grids” by verifying in the full image that **numbered grid bubbles (6/5/4.5)** are indeed present and usable for location.  
  - Treated door “176” near Veil Storage as **tag-ambiguous** and documented it as a **door location/function** rather than a definitive door ID.

- **Verification:**  
  - Cross-checked that **Corridor – Baptistry 180** runs north–south at **F–E** tying the **Clothing Issue 178 / Vestibule Clothing 179** area to **Storage 161B / Confirmation 162** and up to the **Baptistry support suite**.  
  - Confirmed grid bubble sequence and presence of numbered grid bubbles **8–4.5** on the right margin.

- **Confidence:**  
  - **High:** room names/numbers, overall adjacencies, corridor connectivity, grid system, major callout references, revision deltas, FEC labels.  
  - **Medium:** exact room extents across multiple bays (crop limits prevent exact corner-to-corner grid intersection mapping).  
  - **Low:** window identification and door tag numbering (resolution/legibility constraints).
