Top-left quadrant of **TempleTest_Add2, Page 1** showing primarily **structural/grid and overall plan setup** with a small portion of a room at the far right edge.

## Grid / layout control (dominant content)
- **Vertical grid bubbles at top** (left-to-right across the upper edge of this region):
  - **Grid “I”** (left side of region)
  - **Grid “H”** (near top-center)
  - **Grid “G”** (upper right area)
- **Horizontal spacing dimensioning along the top** between vertical grids:
  - **11'-8"** shown between **Grid I and Grid H** (dimension text centered between the two gridlines).
  - **27'-0"** shown between **Grid H and Grid G**.
- **Dashed gridline extensions** run downward from the grid bubbles (light dashed/centerline style), indicating grid lines continuing through the plan.
- **Large dashed rectangular/orthogonal layout lines** traverse the region (likely major reference lines / extents), crossing the gridlines and forming an open, mostly blank field in this quadrant.

## Vertical overall dimensions at left
- Along the **left side** is a **vertical dimension string** with two stacked dimensions (dimension line with tick marks at ends):
  - Upper segment labeled **17'-11"**.
  - Lower segment labeled **23'-11 1/2"**.
  - These appear to reference distances between two dashed horizontal reference lines (one near mid-height and one lower).

## View / detail / section callouts visible
- **Section/detail reference marker** near the right-middle of the region:
  - Circular tag with triangular pointers (section-style marker) labeled **“2 / A42-03”** (view number **2**, sheet **A42-03**). The arrows indicate the direction of view.
- **Another section/detail reference marker** closer to the right-lower area:
  - Labeled **“1 / A42-03”**.
- **Callout bubble near bottom-center/left**:
  - Circular callout labeled **“3 / A71-01”** (view/detail 3 on sheet A71-01).
- **Callout bubble near bottom-center/right**:
  - Circular callout labeled **“1 / A71-01”**.

## Partial room/plan content at far right edge (cropped)
Only the **left portion** of a room and adjacent wall assembly is visible on the **far right**:
- **Room label** (partially readable due to crop):
  - **“VEIL STORAGE”** with a room number **“176”** beneath it (stacked text).
- **Door** into/within the Veil Storage area:
  - A **swing door** is visible with a curved swing arc; the door is labeled **“176”** near the swing (likely door ID or related tag as shown in the crop).
  - Door appears to swing inward relative to the visible room boundary (hinge side at the wall; arc shown into the room side that is visible).
- **Wall construction** at the room’s left boundary:
  - Thickened wall lines indicate a **partition/wall edge** with a vertical run.
- **Fixtures / elements** (partially visible):
  - A **toilet/water closet symbol** is visible just left of the cropped room interior boundary (only partially in frame), suggesting an adjacent restroom or plumbing area immediately to the left of/adjacent to the Veil Storage zone.
- **Red revision/cloud markup**:
  - A **red revision cloud** traces along the upper portion of the visible room/wall corner at the top-right edge of the crop, indicating a revised area boundary.
- **Hatched millwork/solid elements**:
  - Rectangular blocks with diagonal hatch (consistent with the legend’s **MILLWORK** hatch) appear along the upper interior edge of the cropped room; only portions are visible.

## What is NOT present / not visible in this region
- No title block is visible in this quadrant.
- No full room tags other than the partial **VEIL STORAGE 176** are fully readable.
- No window tags or explicit window callouts are visible in this crop.
- No matchline text is visible here.
- No keynote text is directly shown in this quadrant (only view/detail references).

## Spatial relationships / orientation (retrieval cues)
- The region is dominated by **open plan space** defined by **Grid I–H–G** with top spacing **11'-8"** (I–H) and **27'-0"** (H–G), and left-side vertical extents **17'-11"** and **23'-11 1/2"** between dashed horizontal reference lines.
- Architectural content is concentrated at the **far right edge**, where **VEIL STORAGE 176** and its **swing door** are partially shown, adjacent to a plumbing fixture zone and encompassed by a **revision cloud** at the top-right.
