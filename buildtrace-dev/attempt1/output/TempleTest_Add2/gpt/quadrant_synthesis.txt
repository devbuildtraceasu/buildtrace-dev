## GRID SYSTEM
**Orientation & structure (verified against full image + quadrant captions):**
- **Vertical (north–south) grid lines are lettered** across the top: **I, H, G, F, E, D.5**. (Q1: I/H/G; Q2: F/E/D.5; Full image confirms sequence left→right.)
- **Horizontal (east–west) grid lines are numbered** along the right side: **8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5** (Q2 shows 8 & 7; Q4 shows 6/5/4.5 “bubbles”; full image confirms these are horizontal grid bubbles at right margin).
- **Key control dimensions shown on the plan:**
  - Between **I–H = 11'-8"**; **H–G = 27'-0"** (Q1).
  - Between **F–E ≈ 23'-2 1/2"**; **E–D.5 ≈ 17'-0 1/2"**; and another top control **≈ 23'-7"** near F span (Q2; confirmed present in full image but small).
  - Left vertical overall string in Q1: **17'-11"** and **23'-11 1/2"** between dashed horizontals (Q1).
  - Left vertical dimension in Q3: **18'-5"** (Q3; present in full image at left of Area A).

**Grid-location convention used below (since the left-side numbered grids are not visible in this sheet crop):**
- Locations are expressed as **(Letter-bay) × (Number-line band)**, e.g., **“between F–E, near Grid 7”** or **“at E–F / 6–7 zone”**.
- Where exact bay limits can’t be proven (due to missing left-side numbered bubbles), I state **approximate extents** and mark confidence.

## SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS (adjacencies, connections, flow paths)

### Primary circulation spine (central)
- **ENTRY VESTIBULE 100 → ENTRY 101 → (east/northeast) support vestibules (104) → baptistry-related corridor network.**  
  - Q3 establishes the public entry/waiting cluster.  
  - Full image shows circulation continuing rightward into the central spine that becomes **CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY 180** (Q4) which then feeds baptistry suite (Q2).

### Baptistry support suite clustering (service-to-sacred sequence)
- **Showers (171/172) + Laundry (175) → Dressing (173) → Restroom (174) → Vestibule (170) → Baptistry (169)**  
  - This sequence is spatially consistent in Q2 and matches full image arrangement.

### Clothing issue to patron waiting relationship
- **PATRON WAITING 114** sits south of **CLOTHING ISSUE 178** and near the **Baptistry Corridor 180** (Q4), indicating patron staging near clothing distribution, then movement into corridor toward confirmation/storage and further north to baptistry suite.

### Storage / confirmation cluster off corridor
- **CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY 180** provides controlled access to **STORAGE 161B** and **CONFIRMATION 162** (Q4), both positioned east of the corridor and near Grid 6–7.

## REASONING AND SOURCES

### How synthesis was performed
- I treated each quadrant caption as a **high-confidence index** for its region, then cross-checked placement and continuity using the **full drawing image** (notably for: corridor continuity, baptistry suite placement, clothing issue block, and grid bubble positions).
- I deduplicated repeated callouts (e.g., multiple **A60-71** diamonds in Q4; multiple **3/A75-20** in Q2) by keeping **unique sheet references** and noting repetition where relevant.
- For grid locations, I used only the **grid bubbles actually visible**: letters across the top (I through D.5) and numbers at right (8 through 4.5). Where a room spans beyond a precise intersection, I expressed it as a **bay range** (e.g., “between F–E, near Grid 7–8”).

### Information from Q1
- Extracted: **Grids I/H/G**, top dimensions **11'-8"** and **27'-0"**, left vertical dims **17'-11" / 23'-11 1/2"**, callouts **2/A42-03, 1/A42-03, 3/A71-01, 1/A71-01**, partial **VEIL STORAGE 176** and its door, revision cloud at top-right.

### Information from Q2
- Extracted: baptistry suite rooms **169–175**, grids **F/E/D.5** and horizontal grids **7/8**, top control dimensions, extensive callouts to **A71-01, A60-11/12/20, A76-05/06, A75-20, AG05-32**, revision deltas **F/K/B**, FEC label.

### Information from Q3
- Extracted: entry cluster rooms **100/101/102/152** plus partial **103/104/105**, view title and scale, left dimension **18'-5"**, multiple callouts **A71-02, A42-01, A75-30, A72-02**, diamonds **A60-31/A60-15/A60-30**, **SF01** tag, **46 1/4"** note, revision cloud **K**.

### Information from Q4
- Extracted: rooms **114, 161B, 162, 177, 178, 179, 180**, corridor-centric revision clouds and deltas **K/J**, callouts/diamonds **A60-71/A60-21/A60-74/A60-30/A60-50**, circle **9/A75-05 SIM**, FEC label, and right-side grid bubbles **6/5/4.5** (used as horizontal grid identifiers).

### Full image verification
- Confirmed that:
  - The **lettered grids** across the top align left→right as **I, H, G, F, E, D.5**.
  - The **numbered grid bubbles** on the right include **8, 7, 6, 5, 4.5**, consistent with Q2/Q4.
  - **Corridor 180** runs vertically and links the clothing issue zone (Q4) up toward the baptistry support suite (Q2).
  - Large program blocks (Non-Patron Waiting 102; Clothing Issue 178; Baptistry 169) are positioned as described in their quadrants.

### Conflicts resolved
- **Potential confusion:** Q4 refers to “large circular bubbles 6/5/4.5” and notes no structural grids; Q2 calls out grid bubbles 7/8.  
  **Resolution:** Full image shows these are indeed the **horizontal numbered grid bubbles**; Q4’s statement “no full structural grid bubbles/letters” is true for letters, but the numbered bubbles are still grid references.
- **Door IDs:** Q1 mentions a door labeled “176” near Veil Storage; legend says door tags are typically “001”.  
  **Resolution:** I treated “176” at that door as **possibly room-related or cropped tag ambiguity** and did **not** assert a formal door number—only a door location and function.

### Confidence assessment
- **High confidence:** room names/numbers; overall adjacency and circulation; grid letter/number system; callout sheet references explicitly listed in quadrant captions.
- **Medium confidence:** exact grid-span extents for rooms (since left-side numbered grids are not visible and some room boundaries cross multiple bays).
- **Low confidence:** door identifiers/numbers and window inventory (not legible / not provided clearly).
