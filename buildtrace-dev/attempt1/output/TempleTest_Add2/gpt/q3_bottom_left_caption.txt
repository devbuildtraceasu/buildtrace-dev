Architectural floor plan crop, **TempleTest_Add2 – Page 1**, **Region: q3_bottom_left (bottom-left quadrant)**. This region shows part of **FLOOR PLAN – LEVEL 01 AREA A** with multiple room tags, door swings, wall openings, and several keyed/detail callouts. A red revision/cloud markup encloses portions of the entry/first aid closet zone and a small area at the upper-right edge of the crop.

  - At least one large swing door is shown at the bottom edge near **ENTRY VESTIBULE 100**, with a swing arc indicating an exterior/interior entry door.
  - Another swing door is shown near the transition from vestibule toward Entry 101 (two adjacent swing arcs are visible in this area, suggesting paired or closely spaced doors).

- Doors associated with the right-edge rooms (partial):
  - Door swings are visible for **RESTROOM 105** and internal doors around **VESTIBULE 104** / **SHOE & COAT 103**, but details are partially cut off.

  - The perimeter and internal partitions around **Non-Patron Waiting 102**.
  - Partition enclosure for **First Aid Closet 152**.
  - Vestibule partitions around **Entry Vestibule 100**.
- A thickened wall/column-like hatched element appears at the lower-right area of the crop within/near **Entry 101** (rectangular hatched block suggesting a structural pier/column or special construction zone; no label inside this region).
- Multiple small wall returns and recessed/offset conditions are visible at the west/left side of Non-Patron Waiting 102, including a narrow vertical chase-like area and jamb conditions.

---

## Fixtures / equipment / symbols
- At left-middle: a **square dashed outline** containing a **circular concentric symbol** (possibly a site/fixture/structural/MEP element). No label besides nearby callouts (**2/A71-02**) and the **A60-15** diamond reference in the vicinity.
- Upper-right (partial Restroom 105): restroom fixtures are partially visible (sink and toilet outlines), but only partially within this crop.

---

## Notes / labels / dimensions (visible text)
- Vertical dimension at left: **“18'-5"”**.

- A small label **“FEC”** appears near the right side within/near the Shoe & Coat / Vestibule area (exact meaning not defined in the provided legend; text is clearly “FEC”).

---

## Circulation / adjacency summary (flow)
- **Entry Vestibule 100** serves as the transitional space at the lower-left/center, feeding into:
  - **Entry 101** (main open entry space to the right).
  - **First Aid Closet 152** (small closet directly above/adjacent; access via swing door).
- **Non-Patron Waiting 102** sits above Entry 101 and connects via a door at its lower side to the Entry zone.
- Right edge indicates additional program spaces (**Vestibule 104**, **Shoe & Coat 103**, **Restroom 105**) connected via doors and short corridors/vestibule partitions, but their full layouts extend beyond this crop.

---

## Legend-context symbol meanings (only as applicable to what is visible here)
- **Room tags**: room name + room number (used for ENTRY 101, NON-PATRON WAITING 102, FIRST AID CLOSET 152, ENTRY VESTIBULE 100, etc.).
- **Section/callout tags**: circular references like **4/A71-02**, **2/A71-02**, etc. indicate view/detail number over sheet number.
- **“SIM” / “TYP.”** abbreviations are defined in legend but are not clearly shown in this crop.
- Fire rating bars, clearance diagrams, hatch keys are part of the sheet legend but not explicitly depicted as legend graphics inside this crop region.
