  - **2'-6"** width (dimension shown at top)
  - **4'-0"** depth/length (dimension shown at side)
- Labeled **SINK & URINAL CLEARANCE**.

### C. Toilet Clearance

## 4) Matchline Tag Convention

### MATCHLINE TAGS
A matchline reference format showing how the matchline is annotated:
- **“MATCHLINE, SEE: [sheet]”** (example shows “1/A00-00” formatting)
- For the matchline reference, the legend indicates placement conventions:
  - **View Number (above matchline)**
  - **Sheet Number (above matchline)**
  - **Sheet Number (below matchline)**
  - **View Number (below matchline)**

(Meaning: the view/sheet reference is split above/below the matchline so each side references the continuation.)

---

## 5) Fire Rating Graphic Key

### FIRE RATINGS (line/edge graphic)
Two graphic bars are shown, keyed to fire-resistance rating:
- **1 HR FRR** = 1-hour fire-resistance rating (associated with the first bar graphic).
- **2 HR FRR** = 2-hour fire-resistance rating (associated with the second bar graphic).

(“FRR” = **Fire Resistance Rating**.)

---

## 6) Hatch / Material Pattern Key

### HATCH PATTERNS
- **Millwork**: hatch pattern shown as diagonal 45° parallel lines (single-direction diagonal hatch) labeled **MILLWORK**.

# SHEET NOTE SCHEDULE (Keyed Notes) — items visible in legend strip
At bottom of the legend strip a “SHEET NOTE SCHEDULE” table is shown; the left “#” column is cut off in the provided region, but the **descriptions** are legible. These are keynotes/notes referenced elsewhere on the sheet:

1. **Touchless actuator control for door auto operator.**  
2. **Basis of design: LCN 8310-8103. Refer to interior elevations.**  
3. **Knoxbox – final location TBD. To be tied into security system.**  
4. **Linear floor drain. See plumbing drawings for more info.**  
5. **Phenolic shower door.**  
6. **Phenolic ADA bench.**

(If you need the actual keynote numbers exactly as printed, the left side of the schedule with the “#” column must be visible; in this crop the numbering column is not readable.)

---

## Abbreviations explicitly shown in this legend strip
- **SIM** = Similar (if applicable)
- **TYP. / (TYP.)** = Typical
- **FRR** = Fire Resistance Rating
- **ADA** = Americans with Disabilities Act
- **TBD** = To Be Determined

If you want, I can also extract the **General Notes – Floor Plan** text block on this same legend strip (it contains conventions that affect interpretation), but it is separate from the “Floor Plan Graphic Legend” symbol key.
