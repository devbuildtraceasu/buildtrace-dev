### 1. GRID SYSTEM
The drawing utilizes a complex, non-linear grid system divided into two main zones (North/Building and South/Backyard).

*   **Vertical Grid Lines (X-Axis):**
    *   **Range:** 0 to 37.
    *   **West Zone (0-17):** Defines the Office, Bale Storage, and West Yard. Spacing varies (approx 25').
    *   **East Zone (18-37):** Defines the MRF Building and East Yard.
    *   **Sub-grids:** 2.1, 14.1, 31.1, 31.2, 31.3.
*   **Horizontal Grid Lines (Y-Axis):**
    *   **Range:** A to GG.
    *   **North Zone (A-G):** Defines the Office, MRF, and Bale Storage.
    *   **South Zone (N-GG):** Defines the Backyard and Restrooms.
    *   **Sub-grids:** C.1-C.6, D.1-D.2, EE.1.
*   **Orientation:** Plan North is oriented Up and slightly Left (indicated by arrow in bottom right).

### 6. SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS & FLOW

1.  **Site Access:**
    *   **North:** Access from De Garmo Ave via Door D11 (Roll-up) and pedestrian doors.
    *   **West:** Access from Pendleton Street.
    *   **East:** Access from Randall Street (indicated by property line and notes).

2.  **Operational Flow:**
    *   The **Office** acts as the administrative hub, connected directly to the **MRF** via Door D9.
    *   The **MRF (101)** is the central processing area, containing "Chamber 1". It opens to the North (De Garmo) and likely to the South Backyard (though specific large doors aren't explicitly tagged on the south wall, the open grid suggests flow).
    *   The **Backyard (102)** is a massive circulation zone for vehicles/equipment, containing "Chamber 2" and "Chamber 3" and the "Recycling Equipment" zone.
    *   **Bale Storage (103)** is a sub-processing area accessible from the Backyard via Door D5.

3.  **Egress Paths:**
    *   From MRF: North to De Garmo, East via Break Room corridor (D17).
    *   From Office: North to De Garmo, West to Pendleton, South to Front Yard.
    *   From Bale Storage: South to Backyard.
