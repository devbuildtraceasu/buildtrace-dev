**Drawing Title:** FIRST FLOOR PLAN (1/A-111)
**Project:** Crown Recycling Services (Sun Valley, CA)
**Scale:** 1/32" = 1'-0"

**Overview:**
This drawing depicts the comprehensive First Floor Plan for the Crown Recycling Services facility. The layout illustrates a large industrial site comprising an existing Office/Maintenance building, a Material Recovery Facility (MRF), a Bale Storage building, and an extensive exterior Backyard/Service Yard. The site is bounded by De Garmo Avenue to the North, Pendleton Street to the West, and Randall Street to the East.

**6. SUMMARY**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This First Floor Plan (A-111) details a complex industrial recycling facility. It features **7 major spatial zones** (Office, MRF, Bale Storage, Break Room, Restrooms, Front Yard, Backyard) and **3 specific containment chambers**. The structure is a mix of existing concrete buildings and Pre-Engineered Metal Buildings (PEMB), indicated by specific structural keynotes (P1-P8). The site is heavily gridded for precise location of industrial equipment and structural elements, spanning approximately 300 feet in width (West-East) and depth (North-South).
