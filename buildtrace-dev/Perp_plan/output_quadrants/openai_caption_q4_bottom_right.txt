Architectural drawing caption – TempleTest_Add1, page 1, region q4_bottom_right (bottom‑right quadrant)

Overall content:
- Bottom‑right quadrant of an architectural sheet combining: partial Level 01 floor plan, graphic symbol legend, sheet note schedule, and full title block / project information.
- Sheet appears to be part of construction documents for a religious building, labeled “NEW TEMPLE PROJECT.”

PART 1 – FLOOR PLAN FRAGMENT (left side of region)

Visible rooms and room labels:
- “VESTIBULE – CLOTHING” room label appears partially at upper left of region; most of the room is outside this quadrant. No room number visible within this crop.
- “CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY” room label located just right of “VESTIBULE – CLOTHING,” between two doors. No room number visible in this crop.
- “STORAGE” room labeled roughly near middle upper of the plan fragment, text “STORAGE” and a room area or number below it reading “1.85? SF” (only partially legible; appears like “1.85? SF”).
- “CONFIRMATION” room labeled to the right of “STORAGE”; text “CONFIRMATION,” with smaller text under it possibly a room number or area “1.82?” (not fully legible).
- Several walls and circulation spaces below these rooms with no visible labels in this quadrant.

Doors:
- Multiple single‑leaf swing doors into and between rooms:
  - Door from “VESTIBULE – CLOTHING” swinging into the corridor (door head and swing arc visible near left side).
  - Door from “CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY” into “STORAGE” room; door leaf swings into “STORAGE.”
  - Door from “CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY” into “CONFIRMATION” room; door leaf swings into “CONFIRMATION.”
  - Additional doors along the corridor walls at far left edge of region (door frames and swings visible but connected rooms mostly outside quadrant).
- No explicit door tags or numbers are legible within this specific crop; only graphic door symbols.

Windows / exterior openings:
- No typical window symbols are visible in this quadrant.
- A short exterior wall segment at lower center/right includes a thick wall and a small projection but no glazing indicated.

Dimensions:
- Vertical dimension strings along interior walls partly visible:
  - One dimension text along wall at left of “VESTIBULE – CLOTHING” reading approximately “11'‑1 1/8"” (text partly truncated).
  - Another dimension along wall below corridor area reading “??'‑??” (not fully legible due to crop and scale).
- Inside room “CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY” there are short dimension strings adjacent to plumbing fixture area, but the numeric text is not clearly legible in the image.

Fixtures / equipment:
- Inside “CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY” near the junction with “STORAGE,” a circular symbol and line work indicating plumbing or mechanical fixture at wall (could be a floor drain or similar).
- A small rectangle near that circle indicates an associated device or control box (exact label not legible).

Section / detail / reference tags on plan:
- Various diamond‑shaped callout tags:
  - In “VESTIBULE – CLOTHING” there is a diamond tag with text “A5/3A1” (best reading: top line “A5” bottom line “3A1”).
  - In “CORRIDOR – BAPTISTRY” another diamond tag near middle with similar configuration “A5/3A1.”
  - In “STORAGE” one diamond tag again reading “A5/3A1.”
  - In “CONFIRMATION” one diamond tag “A5/3A1.”
  - Near the bottom edge, another diamond tag close to an exterior corner labeled “A9/5A0” (top “A9”, bottom “5A0”).
- Circular matchline / reference bubble along right side of plan labeled “5” (inside circle) located adjacent to legend area, likely indicating a referencing key (corresponds to item “5” in legend list).
- Another circular matchline / reference bubble at lower right of plan fragment, label “4.5” (inside circle) indicating match or key point along grid / sheet.

Walls and construction:
- Interior walls shown with standard double‑line wall graphics.
- Thicker exterior wall at lower center/right of the fragment suggesting a perimeter or structural wall.
- A cross‑shaped symbol in a wall segment between corridor and adjacent area (could be a column or structural element).
- Doors are drawn with typical jambs and arcs.
