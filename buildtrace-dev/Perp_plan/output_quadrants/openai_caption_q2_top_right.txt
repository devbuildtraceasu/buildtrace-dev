Architectural drawing: “TempleTest_Add1”, page/sheet 1, region: top‑right quadrant (q2_top_right). This region contains the upper right portion of a floor plan plus a large notes/legend and title‑block zone to the extreme right.

---

### 1. Floor plan content visible in this quadrant

**General layout**

- Portion of an interior floor plan at upper left of the region; lower right of region is predominantly text, legends, and title‑block graphics.
- Plan is drawn in black linework with red revision clouds and tags.
- Plan north arrow for the sheet appears separately in the legend area at far right; plan within this quadrant is partially cut off.

**Rooms / spaces and labels**

- “BAPTISTRY VESTIBULE – SISTERS 130”  
  - Text in all caps, black, near top‑left of the quadrant, close to a thick wall assembly.
- “BAPTISTRY DRESSING – SISTERS 131”  
  - Label in red text (appears as part of a revision cloud annotation) along the left‑center edge of this quadrant.
- “BAPTISTRY 150”  
  - Black text next to a central octagonal or polygonal space containing pews or bench seating (shown in plan).
- Additional space label near top center: unclear due to cropping, but the text “VESTIBULE–” and “SISTERS” are visible along with room number “130”.
- A small area with a sink/counter (two circular basins) is visible adjacent to the red‑clouded dressing area; no separate room label visible in this crop.

**Doors and door tags**

Multiple door swings are visible, each with a diamond‑shaped door tag (black outline, white interior) containing a number over a sheet reference:

- Door tag near top center: diamond with “4” over small text “A71.40?” (exact sheet number partly obscured).
- Door tag near top center inside vestibule area: diamond with “2” over “A71.40?” (exact).
- Door tag near mid‑left just below the vestibule wall: diamond with “2” over “A60.34” (sheet reference clearly legible in one symbol near mid‑right of plan).
- Door tag near center‑left inside red revision cloud for dressing area: appears as diamond “2” over “A60.34” or similar.
- Door tag just right of center near octagonal baptistry seating: diamond “11” over “A76.08” (or “476.08”; number is small but clearly an 11).
- Multiple additional diamond door tags along lower edge of this region:  
  - “2” over “A60.34” located near bottom‑center.  
  - “2” over “A75.20” at lower right of the plan area beside some linear elements drawn as benches or seating.  
  - Another door tag at bottom right margin of the plan: diamond with “7” over unreadable sheet reference (partially clipped).

**Dimensions**

- Horizontal overall dimension line at very top of image, above plan:  
  - Left segment label: “23'-4 1/2"”.  
  - Right segment label: “17'-9 1/2"”.  
  - Dimension string appears between gridlines or reference points, with tick marks at each end.
- Radial or small local dimensions around fixtures/seating in baptistry area are present but the numeric text is generally too small to read in this crop.

**Walls and structural elements**

- Heavy exterior or major interior walls with multiple parallel lines, likely indicating layered construction.
- Thinner interior partitions defining smaller rooms and corridors.
- A stair or step element labeled “OPEN TO BELOW” is visible at right of the octagonal seating area; this annotation is in small black text next to a boundary with arrows or a break line.

**Fixtures / furniture**

- Inside the central baptistry space “BAPTISTRY 150” is a polygonal seating layout with multiple pews/benches drawn in plan, oriented toward a central area.
- Adjacent to “BAPTISTRY DRESSING – SISTERS 131” is a bank of fixtures:  
  - A rectangular casework element with multiple narrow rectangles (likely lockers or cubbies).  
  - A counter with two round sink symbols.
- Several circle symbols with crosshairs and other annotation marks correspond to ceiling or lighting fixtures (identified in other sheets; here no local labels).
- Red dashed outline (revision cloud) surrounds portions of the dressing area, casework, and nearby partitions.

**Grid / reference bubbles**

- Circular grid or reference bubble near right of the plan with number “8”.
- Another circular bubble toward bottom center with number “7”.
- A right‑edge callout bubble “D.5” near top edge, extending from a leader line.

**Section / detail callouts**

- Triangular or circular callout markers with leaders and text such as “A60.34”, “A75.20”, “A76.08”, “A75.91?” etc., indicating references to detail or section sheets.  
- Example clearly readable: symbol with triangle, number “5” above, “A60.34” below.
