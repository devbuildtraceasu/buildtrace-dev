Plan area – rooms, labels, and annotations (left and center)  

General layout  
- Plan appears to cover a mix of public circulation, lobby/reception, support spaces, and some specialty spaces.  
- Doors drawn with standard arcs, many labeled with door numbers in rectangular tags (numbers not legible at overview).  
- Windows indicated in exterior walls as thin rectangles; some have tags.  
- Stairs, elevators, and millwork counters are shown with outlines and hatching.  
- Red cloud lines around several areas indicate revised work in this addendum.  
- Hatching:  
  - Diagonal hatch across some rooms/areas, possibly “NOT IN CONTRACT” or “FUTURE WORK”.  
  - Crosshatch or solid hatch at casework, counters, or masonry.  

Specific rooms/areas (reading roughly from left to right, top to bottom)  
- Lower left corner:  
  - Exterior entrance vestibule or small room with door swinging inward from exterior (door at far left).  
  - Immediately adjacent interior room labeled “OFFICE” or similar; tag unreadable.  
  - Dimensional strings along exterior wall for building offsets.  
- Large open space approx. at left‑center labeled “MULTI‑PURPOSE” or “WAITING” with a room tag (looks like “WP WAITING” or similar); contains multiple keynote symbols.  
- Rooms along central bottom: a row of smaller rooms with doors off a corridor, including labels such as:  
  - “STORAGE”,  
  - “JANITOR”,  
  - “ELEC”,  
  - “MECH”,  
  - “MEN” and “WOMEN” restrooms (with typical restroom fixtures shown—water closets, lavatories)  
  - Possibly “CLOSET” and “FAMILY” or “UNISEX” toilet.  
- A corridor or lobby running horizontally across mid‑plan, with multiple doors leading to rooms above and below.  
- Upper‑central region: medium‑size room with partial hatch labeled something like “LOBBY” or “VESTIBULE”; has seating or pew‑like benches indicated by repetitive rectangular shapes near top right.  
- Near upper right: a complex shaped area with casework counters arranged in a semi‑circular or angular pattern—likely a “RECEPTION DESK” or “RECOMMEND DESK” area associated with temple use. Tags around this area include keynotes for millwork and glazing.  
- Cluster of small rooms above corridor but below main entry: could include “INTERVIEW”, “OFFICE”, “CUSTODIAL”, or “LOCKER” rooms; each has a rectangular room tag with a number and short name.  
- Vertical circulation: In central area near the corridor there appears to be a stair represented with up/down arrows and treads; labeled with “STAIR 01” or similar. An elevator may be nearby (square with “ELEV” or lift symbol).  
- At far right bottom: a thicker wall belonging to adjacent building area outside the scope, with open connection via doors.  

Doors and windows  
- Every door has:  
  - Door leaf with swing arc.  
  - A rectangular or circular door tag adjacent to it, with numeric designation (e.g., “110A”, “110B” etc.—exact numbers illegible but tags visible).  
  - Some doors are pairs; some are single.  
- Some doors include sidelites or borrowed lites indicated by narrow glazed panel next to frame.  
- Windows appear primarily in exterior walls at top and left, drawn as thin breaks in wall line with sill lines; some have window number tags similar to “W‑1”, “W‑2”.  

Dimensions  
- Dimension strings run outside perimeter and at key interior alignments:  
  - Outer dimension lines measure between grid lines and major wall faces, using tick marks and numerical values (numbers too small to read but clearly present).  
  - Interior dimensions indicate room sizes, door locations, offsets of walls from grids, etc.  
  - Radial/angled dimensions not apparent; plan appears orthogonal.  

Annotations and keynotes inside plan  
- Numerous diamond‑shaped keynote symbols with alphanumeric codes such as “3A4”, “4A1”, “2A3” etc., referencing Sheet Note Schedule or a project keynotes list.  
- Some keynote text (black) refers to architectural scope; red text indicates new/revised items in this addendum.  
- Example labels close to symbols (partial legibility):  
  - “NEW STUD PARTITION, SEE WALL TYPE ___.”  
  - “PATCH EXISTING FLOOR FINISH.”  
  - “REMOVE EXISTING DOOR AND FRAME; PREPARE OPENING FOR NEW.”  
  - “NEW MILLWORK – SEE INTERIOR ELEVATIONS.”  
  - “NEW ACOUSTICAL CEILING SYSTEM – SEE RCP.”  
  - “SMOKE SEAL AT TOP OF PARTITION.”  
- Several clouded revision areas, with tags like “REV 1” or “ADD 1” near bubbles referencing revision block.  

Mechanical/other coordination marks  
- Triangular symbols or other icons denote thermostats, return air grilles, etc., but are incidental and generally unlabeled here; main emphasis is architecture.  
- Dashed rectangles at floor may indicate plumbing trenches, floor slopes to drain, or equipment slabs.

Circulation and exits  
- Main entrance doors (likely top or right side) shown as double doors with adjacent vestibule and lobby.  
- Egress path may be indicated by red dashed line with arrow, illustrating accessible route or means of egress (seen winding from interior rooms to an exit).  

Miscellaneous text/labels  
- “LEVEL 01” text placed near center bottom of drawing.  
- Some hatches labeled “EXISTING” or “NEW” though not legible; differentiation by lineweight/gray shading.  
- A note near a stair may say “UP TO LEVEL 02” or “DOWN TO LOWER LEVEL”.  
- A few zones are cross‑hatched and labeled “NOT IN CONTRACT” or “NIC,” especially at extreme right or lower right where the plan connects with areas outside this scope.  
- Elevation markers: circular symbols with arrow pointing to wall faces, with numbers like “1/A301”, “2/A302”, etc., indicating elevation or section drawings on other sheets.  
- Section cut symbols: thick line crossing rooms with labels “A204/01” etc., referencing section details.

Borders and plotting info  
- Outer rectangular sheet border with small registration and plotting marks at corners.  
- Left vertical margin contains rotated text such as “ARCHITECTURAL – FLOOR PLAN – LEVEL 01 AREA A – A204.05” indicating sheet name when bound.  

In summary, this sheet is an architectural enlarged floor plan for “Level 01 – Area A” of a temple project for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints, prepared by NORR. It includes: detailed layout of rooms, corridors, stair, restrooms, reception and support spaces; all doors and some windows with tags; extensive general notes and floor plan graphic legend; sheet note schedule keyed via diamond symbols; revision and title block information; and a small key plan showing Area A in context of the full building. All visible text, though some illegible at this scale, pertains to room names/numbers, door tags, keynotes, dimension figures, and coordination notes as described above.
